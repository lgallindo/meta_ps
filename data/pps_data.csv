The result has often been divided control of government and an apparent inability to address major political problems. This address develops the historical foundation for these characteristics.

The post-War period saw the full development of candidate-centered elections. While the breakup of Jim Crow due to the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts in the mid-1960s ended Jim Crow and made possible a competitive party system in the South, the later was delayed until the full implementation of the Republican&#8217;s &#8220;southern strategy&#8221; in 1980 and beyond.

Because multiparty elections in autocracies are partially free but unfair, opposition parties are compelled to compete for office while contesting the rules of competition. To fulfill this dual goal, opposition parties actively seek to recruit a wide variety of independent social movements who can provide votes and lead major mobilizations during election campaigns and in post-election rallies to denounce fraud. Because electoral participation can cause divisions within social movements, social activists join socio-electoral coalitions when opposition parties offer them financial and logistic resources and institutional protection to mobilize for their causes during non-election times. This quid pro quo explains how isolated protest events become aggregated into powerful cycles of mobilization and why protest is more intense during elections but persists beyond election cycles. When political liberalization leads to increasingly free and fair elections, the prospect of victory motivates opposition parties to discourage radical mobilization, bringing cycles of protest to an end. Drawing on an original database of indigenous protest in Mexico and on case studies, I provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the causal impact of electoral incentives on the rise, development and decline of a powerful cycle of indigenous protest as Mexico transitioned from one-party to multi-party autocracy and into democracy. Beyond Mexico, I show that the introduction of multiparty elections in a wide variety of autocracies around the world gave rise to major cycles of protest and discuss why the relationship between the ballot and the street is a crucial factor for understanding the dynamics of stability and change of authoritarian regimes.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592714000863","332-352","Guillermo Trejo","This article presents a new explanation of the widespread occurrence of cycles of protest in electoral autocracies &#8211; the most common type of authoritarian regime in the world today.

Taken together, these quantitative and qualitative data offer significant support for our central theoretical claim: contemporary democratic breakdowns have political origins in weak states, not economic origins in class conflict.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2170","566"

The Distributive Impact of Judicializing Social and Economic Rights","While many find cause for optimism about the use of law and rights for progressive ends, the academic literature has long been skeptical that courts favor the poor. We show that, with the move toward a robust &#8220;new constitutionalism&#8221; of social and economic rights, the assumptions underlying the skepticism do not always hold. Our theories must account for variation in the elite bias of law and litigation. In particular, we need to pay closer attention to the broad, collective effects of legal mobilization, rather than focusing narrowly on the litigants and the direct benefits they receive. We support the claim by showing that litigation pursued in legal contexts that create the expectation of collective effects is more likely to avoid the potential anti-poor bias of courts. On the other hand, policy areas dominated by individual litigation and individualized effects are more likely to experience regressive outcomes. Using data on social and economic rights cases in four countries, we estimate the potential pro-poor impact of litigation by examining whether the poor are over- or under-represented among the beneficiaries of litigation. We find that the impact of courts is positive and very much pro-poor in India and South Africa, and slightly negative in Indonesia and Brazil. Overall, we challenge the tendency in the literature to focus on the direct effects of litigation, find that the results of litigation are more positive for the poor than the conventional wisdom would lead us to expect, and offer an explanation that accounts for part of the variation while raising a number of questions for future research.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592714000887","375-393","Daniel M.

I address these questions by critically examining the way that distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate wartime environmental destruction have been drawn in debates on just war theory and the laws of war. I identify four distinctive formulations for framing the wartime significance of nature that appear in such debates and analyze how each is associated with distinctive claims regarding what constitutes &#8220;humaneness&#8221; in times of war: nature as property; nature as combatant; nature as Pandora&#39;s Box; and nature as victim.

Long before &#8220;political science&#8221; took the distinct disciplinary and institutional forms with which we are familiar, the effort to understand the sources and the range of political experience was typically linked to reflection on nature&#8212;the nature of politics, the nature of human beings, the nature of existence, and the nature of &#8220;nature&#8221; itself. In contemporary, post-World War II political science in the United States, much of this reflection about nature has until recently been linked to the work of Leo Strauss and his followers, who saw themselves as heirs to a philosophical discourse at odds with modern social science. At the same time, serious consideration of nature as a theme of political science never disappeared and in recent decades has dramatically expanded. (And of course interpretations of the science of nature, i.e., &#8220;science,&#8221; have been at the center of political science, especially since the advent of behavioralism.) One source of this expansion of interest in nature has no doubt been the growing politicization of &#8220;the environment&#8221; and heightened attention to the natural world as both the setting in which human interaction takes place and the object of extraordinary human transformation and degradation. Another source has been the politicization of identities&#8212;race, gender, sexuality&#8212;that had long been considered natural and whose contestation raised anew questions about &#8220;human nature&#8221; and its limits, variations, and transformations. A third source has clearly been the technological and theoretical development of &#8220;the natural sciences&#8221; themselves, and the growth of new discourses&#8212;evolutionary psychology, behavioral economics, neuroscience&#8212;that raise new questions about the complex relationships between the non-human dimensions of nature&#8212;physics, chemistry, biology and especially neurobiology&#8212;and human individuals and the social worlds that human individuals inhabit.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713001023","363-366","Jeffrey C.

Nearly all those studies utilize convenience samples of university students, but in the real world political elites actually make most pivotal political decisions such as threatening war or changing the course of economic policy. Highly experienced elites are more likely to exhibit the attributes of rational decision-making; and over the last fifteen years a wealth of studies suggest that such elites are likely to be more skilled in strategic bargaining than samples with less germane experience. However, elites are also more likely to suffer overconfidence, which degrades decision-making skills. We illustrate implications for political science with a case study of crisis bargaining between the US and North Korea. Variations in the experience of US elite decision-makers between 2002 and 2006 plausibly explain the large shift in US crisis signaling better than other rival hypotheses such as &#8220;Iraq fatigue.&#8221; Beyond crisis bargaining other major political science theories might benefit from attention to the attributes of individual decision-makers.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713001084","368-386","Emilie M.

The main challenge for theories of rebellion is to explain when and why others join en masse. Scholarship on social movements typically develops answers to this puzzle on the basis of either of two microfoundations. Explanations that conceptualize individuals as utility-maximizers contend that they protest as a means to other ends. Explanations that see individuals as driven by values and beliefs suggest that people protest for the inherent benefit of voicing dissent. Both perspectives generate compelling explanations. Yet how do purposeful individuals act when utilitarian calculations and cherished values recommend contrary courses of action? Why might an actor prioritize one or the other at different points in time? Taking on these questions, I argue for an approach to microfoundations that focuses on emotions. Emotions such as fear, sadness, and shame promote pessimistic assessments, risk aversion, and a low sense of control. Such dispiriting emotions encourage individuals to prioritize security and resign to political circumstances, even when they contradict values of dignity. By contrast, anger, joy, and pride promote optimistic assessments, risk acceptance, and feelings of personal efficacy. Such emboldening emotions encourage prioritization of dignity and increase willingness to engage in resistance, even when it jeopardizes security. When instrumentality and values offer different answers to the question of whether to resign or rebel, therefore, emotions can shift individuals toward one or the other. I ground this argument in findings from the neurosciences and illustrate it with evidence from the 2011 uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt and the absence of an uprising in Algeria.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713001072","387-409","Wendy Pearlman","Northwestern University.

Examples of extra-lethal violence include forcing victims to dance and sing before killing them, souvenir-taking and mutilation. The main puzzle of extra-lethal violence is why it occurs at all given the time and effort it takes to enact such brutalities and the potential repercussions perpetrators risk by doing so. Current approaches cannot account for this puzzle because extra-lethal violence seems to follow a different logic from strategic calculation. To investigate one alternative logic&#8212;the logic of display&#8212;the article proposes a performative analytic framework. A performative lens focuses attention on the process by which actors stage violence for graphic effect. It highlights the range of roles, participants, and activities that contribute to the production process as a whole. To demonstrate the value of a performative approach, the article applies this framework to three very different extra-lethal episodes: the massacre at My Lai during the Vietnam War, the rape and killing of two women during the Rwandan genocide, and a lynching that took place in rural Maryland. The article concludes by sketching a typology of performance processes and by considering the policy implications of this type of theorizing and knowledge.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713001060","410-426","Lee Ann Fujii","Department of Political Science, University of Toronto.

Yet because governments can favor constituencies through the targeting of multiple public and private goods, drawing general conclusions about distributive politics by investigating just one (or even a few) good(s) can be misleading. We demonstrate the severity of this problem by investigating a particular manifestation of distributive politics&#8212;ethnic favoritism&#8212;in a particular setting&#8212;Africa&#8212;and show that the conclusions one draws about who benefits from government allocation decisions can vary markedly depending on the outcome one happens to study. Our findings suggest the need for caution in making general claims about who benefits from distributive politics and raise questions about extant theoretical conclusions that are based on empirical work that focuses on a single distributive outcome. The findings also provide a foundation for a new research agenda aimed at identifying the reasons why political leaders choose to favor their supporters with some public and private goods rather than others.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713001035","461-474","Daniel N.

In recent years progress has been made in closing this gap but many in the political science mainstream view the movement with concern or even horror. Though a healthy dose of skepticism is appropriate and beneficial to the scientific endeavor, negative reactions to viewing politics through a neurobiological lens are often based on fundamental misconceptions regarding both neurobiology and politics. In this Reflections essay, I address ten of these misconceptions, including the beliefs that biology is deterministic, reductionist, unnecessary, irrelevant, normatively dangerous, and ideologically biased. The goal is to encourage a constructive dialogue on the relevance of neurobiology to political life&#8212;a dialogue that would in turn improve research in the fledgling subfield and lead to innovations in political science by encouraging new ways of conceptualizing and analyzing the variables at the discipline&#39;s core.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713000923","475-489","John R.

First, Hibbing argues that the open acknowledgment of the biological basis of group differences would lead to greater tolerance. It is easy to adduce examples to suggest that it is unrealistic to expect that people, especially people with political concerns and objectives, will begin to focus on the diversity within groups rather than the differences between groups.

I argue that like all perspectives on how to advance knowledge, neurobiology must win its place by generating demonstrable results central to our understanding of politics. In agreeing with Hibbing that some hold misperceptions, I note that this is hardly uncommon, even if it is unwelcome in a scientific community. And, finally, I note that narratives of explanation often serve a variety of masters. While those derived from science are meant to restrict the consideration of competing narratives to those that are testable with empirical data, even members of scientific communities find that other claimants have some sway. Among the non-scientific purposes that narratives serve are: achieving simplicity; sustaining communities of mutual agreement; and advancing indulgent doctrines of ennoblement.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271300100X","492-494","George E.

In the Hibbing paper, for example, the question is framed as who is more reductionist&#8212;those wishing to incorporate biology or those &#8216;environmentalist determinists&#8217; who reject biological research? Yet this framing misses one of the most fundamental aspects of scientific theorizing, namely, the vital distinction between reductionism and emergence. Shifting the lens to the emergent properties of behavior raises a different kind of concern: under what conditions do the competing perspectives on the various factors produce an explanation of an emergent outcome. Using Philip Anderson&#39;s example from particle physics, there are many phenomena and behaviors that can only emerge from an interaction of elements. Examining two inert chemicals kept apart cannot explain the complex interaction effect of an explosion when those chemicals come together. Now the question is no longer who is the most reductionist, but who is best positioned to explain &#8220;political explosions&#8221; that otherwise seem to come from nowhere when isolated political elements lay inert side-by-side.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713000947","495-499","Troy Duster","Warren Institute on Law and Social Policy, University of California, Berkeley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1114","231"

Such an approach appreciates the creative element in evolution as well as in subliminal processes in play within and between us. Several practitioners of complexity theory in biology have been exploring such routes. They may contribute to a more layered set of interfaces between biology and cultural interpretation that are even less reductionist in character.

One startling implication is that we often understand ourselves much less well than we are inclined to think. (2) It is seriously mistaken to think that reading the output of an fMRI experiment is as easy and clear as interpreting a realistic picture. Among other things, various interpretations of an output may be equally acceptable. (3) Neuroscience can, and has been, used to support widespread prejudices, such as the intellectual inferiority of the female mind. Major researchers have given in to the temptation to see their older views in the new sciences of the mind.

Securing the participation of nine academics and then cajoling us to meet deadlines and follow instructions is a remarkable accomplishment and I can only hope the finished product approaches his hopes for the enterprise. I would also like to thank the eight scholars who provided commentaries on my target essay. I am truly fortunate that such an all-star cast was willing to spend time pondering the role of neurobiology and politics. They assisted me in better understanding my own positions, and who can ask for more than that? I do not have the space here to offer the point-by-point response that their comments deserve, so I will instead concentrate on the two concerns that were raised most frequently: first, whether biological approaches can answer the kinds of questions political scientists should be asking, and second, whether, regardless of their value in answering questions, applying biological techniques to social behaviors leads to normatively unpalatable conclusions. Before addressing these two important matters, however, it is worth a moment to mention several areas of agreement.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713001011","520-524","John R.

Its sheer heft is daunting, its central claim bold and sweeping, its data relentless. While the planet goes &#8220;cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity,&#8221; Steven Pinker argues, the human species has been progressing. We have reduced the fear of violent death for an ever-greater proportion of the population across the centuries. Pinker argues that every sort of violence has declined, from interpersonal cruelty to interstate war, beginning toward the end of the medieval period and extending to today. He then identifies the causes of decline so that we can know what can extend the trend into the future. This will allow us, as he puts it, to &#8220;obsess not just over what we have been doing wrong but also over what we have been doing right&#8221; (p. xxvi).","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713001114","525-528","Jennifer Mitzen","The Ohio State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1526","441"

Popular books such as Thomas Ricks's Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq (2006), Jane Mayer's The Dark Side (2008), George Packer's Assassins' Gate (2005), and Bob Woodward's series on &#8220;Bush's wars&#8221; captured our attention and gave us a first cut on the history of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the &#8220;global war on terror.&#8221; These riveting accounts provided rich, descriptive insights and exposed the wide range of ideological and bureaucratic feuding, the breakdown&#8212;and often deliberate circumventing&#8212;of institutional procedures and organizational practices, and the ad hoc and often chaotic process of policy selection. Embedded throughout these narratives is a broader theme that depicts the past decade as an extraordinary period of American foreign policy excess and a dramatic departure from the past.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271300090X","532-537","Jon Western","Mount Holyoke College and the Five Colleges, Inc.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","724","192"

More than a decade later, this effort has yielded neither security nor political stability in Afghanistan. After having been ousted from power, the Taliban reestablished itself in the borderlands of Pakistan and began fighting an effective guerrilla war against international and Afghan government forces. Despite heavy losses in recent years, the insurgency shows no sign of giving up. Meanwhile, attempts to establish a credible and legitimate Afghan government have been similarly disappointing. President Hamid Karzai, once hailed as the country's democratic savior, came to be seen instead as the leader of one of the most corrupt regimes on the planet, a perception that has damaged his government's legitimacy both at home and abroad. Afghanistan's development and human rights indicators have improved, but it remains to be seen if these gains can be sustained as the international effort is scaled back. Finally, although the United States and its partners succeeded in weakening Al Qaeda in the region, both Afghanistan and nuclear-armed Pakistan appear to have become considerably less stable over the course of the mission, with untold consequences for the future.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713000911","538-548","Roland Paris","Centre for International Policy Studies, University of Ottawa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4500","2111"

By Miriam R. Lowi. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009. 252p. $94.00, cloth, $31.99 paper.","Although Miriam R. Lowi's primary goal is to explain &#8220;the enigma of Algeria&#8221; (p. 16), her analysis extends far beyond this individual country to shed light on questions that are of broad interest to students of comparative politics. Indeed, as is indicative of all so-called single-country case studies, her in-depth investigation of Algeria's postindependence trajectory&#8212;from its &#8220;unfulfilled expectations&#8221; in the 1980s to its &#8220;descent into violence&#8221; in the 1990s and then &#8220;the [state's] resurgence&#8221; in the 2000s (p. 7)&#8212;is at the outset an attempt to explain a larger class of phenomena. Lowi is quite explicit in this regard. In sum, she seeks to &#8220;extend [her] argument about Algeria&#8221; to explain, first, why oil-rich states experience different kinds of political stability in the face of similar economic shocks, and second, what role, if any, oil wealth has played in fueling these political outcomes (p. 17).","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271300011X","596-598","Pauline Jones Luong","University of Michigan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","348","61"

My principal goals related to Algeria itself: first, to explain the country's peculiar trajectory with political stability and, eventually, its descent into violence, followed by its fascinating restabilization; second, to use the Algerian experience to contribute to the &#8220;rentier state&#8221; literature and show that oil has not been the &#8220;curse&#8221; that the &#8220;resource curse&#8221; folks suggest it to be. My secondary goals had to do with enriching and contextualizing the argument I was making about Algeria. I sought to do so in two ways: by offering &#8220;some preliminary comparisons&#8221; between Algeria's experience and that of other Middle Eastern oil-exporting states at times of economic shocks, and by cautiously extending the argument about variations in stability in Algeria to account for variations in stability in the four other countries. Four of the five empirical chapters of the book are devoted exclusively to Algeria; a single chapter&#8212;what I refer to as &#8220;a brief excursion into comparative analysis&#8221;&#8212;is devoted to Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia and the comparison with Algeria.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713000868","598-598","Miriam R.

How Urban Policies Shape Civic Engagement. By Elaine B. Sharp. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2012. 248p. $67.50 cloth, $22.50 paper.","Like most fields of knowledge, political science tends to progress incrementally. Typically, a political scientist develops a model about a prominent institution or common behavior and that model becomes the starting point for understanding all its other permutations. This is especially the case in studies of American state and local government, which tend to follow theories of national politics. Scholars of state legislatures typically begin their analysis by using studies of the U.S. Congress, analysts of local elections start with presidential vote models, and so on. But, as Elaine Sharp reminds us in Does Local Government Matter?, we should not be so quick to assume that models or theories about national-level politics translate easily to the local level. In fact, local politics may operate under logics all their own.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271300114X","599-600","J.

How Urban Policies Shape Civic Engagement","One thing our books and mutual reviews show that we very much agree on is the challenge in the study of local politics of adapting data collected for other purposes to the testing of theories of interest. We also clearly agree that local government does matter&#8212;that is, that what it does affects the shape and character of local civic engagement. But it is not clear that we see the relevance of policy feedback theory for local government in the same way. Specifically, while J. Eric Oliver's review reveals an appreciation of the ways in which local government action may yield resource effects, the interpretive effects that are arguably the more innovative component of policy feedback theory may be underappreciated. It is likely that this difference links to a deeper, underlying difference in views on what it means for local government to matter.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713000832","600-601","Elaine B.

By J. Eric Oliver with Shang E. Ha and Zachary Callen. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2012. 234p. $75.00 cloth, $29.95 paper.","In this creative and important book, Eric Oliver and his coauthors offer a comprehensive analysis of a largely overlooked phenomenon, electoral behavior in smaller communities, here defined as jurisdictions with populations under 100,000. In the broadest sense, the central theme of the book is that elections are different in these small jurisdictions from what theories and empirical analyses of national, state, and big-city elections have made familiar. More specifically, they argue that a triumvirate of jurisdictional characteristics&#8212;1) population size, 2) scope (i.e., the extent to which institutional arrangements provide government officials with powers on a broad array of matters), and 3) bias (i.e., the extent to which government distributes resources in something other than an evenhanded fashion)&#8212;are crucial factors shaping the behavior of voters and candidates and, hence, are the essential character of elections. In separate chapters analyzing who votes, who runs for office, what shapes incumbent advantage, and what shapes voter choice, the authors explore hypotheses developed in their overview chapter about how size, scope, and bias impact each of these aspects of local elections.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713000054","601-603","Elaine B.

Sharp's assessment is both fair and precise. As she notes, there is a big gulf between our book's rather grandiose theory of electoral politics and its subsequent empirical tests. After making some sweeping hypotheses about the role of size, scope, and bias as the primary determinants of electoral politics across all types of democracies, our empirical analysis tested only a limited range of values and cases. While my colleagues and I hope that our theoretical framework will prove useful for future comparative electoral studies, our book does not provide a definitive test.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713000844","603-603","J.

Yet some of the strongest authoritarian parties in the world have not resisted democratization, but have embraced it. This is because their raison d&#39;etre is to continue ruling, not necessarily to remain authoritarian. Democratization requires that ruling parties hold free and fair elections, but not that they lose them. Authoritarian ruling parties can thus be incentivized to concede democratization from a position of exceptional strength as well as extreme weakness. This &#8220;conceding-to-thrive&#8221; scenario is most likely to unfold when regimes (1) possess substantial antecedent political strengths and resource advantages, (2) suffer ominous setbacks signaling that they have passed their apex of domination, and (3) pursue new legitimation strategies to arrest their incipient decline. We illustrate this heretofore neglected alternative democratization pathway through a comparative-historical analysis of three Asian developmental states where ruling parties have democratized from varying positions of considerable strength: Taiwan, South Korea, and Indonesia. We then consider the implications of our analysis for three &#8220;candidate cases&#8221; in developmental Asia where ruling parties have not yet conceded democratization despite being well-positioned to thrive were they to do so: Singapore, Malaysia, and the world&#39;s most populous dictatorship, China.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002090","717-733","Dan Slater","University of Chicago","Joseph Wong","University of Toronto","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","5309","1260"

Evidence from Postcommunist Eurasia","Since the end of the Cold War, political scientists have radically reexamined the role that elections play in authoritarian contexts. Some argue elections are congruent with authoritarianism and actually help to stabilize non-democratic forms of rule. Others challenge this claim by arguing that elections can function as a mechanism for democratization. We test whether elections have functioned as a mechanism of change or of neo-authoritarian stability in the postcommunist world. We generally find that elections neither promote democracy nor strengthen authoritarianism. However, we do find that in energy-rich states elections promote authoritarianism, though of a somewhat more benign sort. We also find that the mechanisms of electoral participation and competitiveness thought to promote democracy function differently in the postcommunist context and explore this in greater detail through a paired case study of electoral mobilization in Slovakia and Belarus.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002119","734-752","Ruchan Kaya","University of Florida","Michael Bernhard","University of Florida","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1706","613"

Are they more likely to engage in such behavior when these uprisings appear to be more threatening&#8212;in particular, when they take place in neighboring countries and in regimes that resemble their own? We provide answers to these questions by comparing the responses of the Russian and Chinese leadership to two such waves: the color revolutions and the Arab uprisings. We conclude that, despite differences in the ostensible threats posed by these two waves, they nonetheless prompted the leaders of both of these countries to introduce similar preemptive measures in order to &#8220;diffusion-proof&#8221; their rule from the color revolutions and the Arab upheavals. These findings have some important implications for our understanding of authoritarian politics and diffusion processes. One is to reinforce the emphasis in many recent studies on the strategic foundations of authoritarian resilience. That recognized, however, we would add that the authoritarian toolkit needs to be expanded to include policies that preempt international, as well as domestic threats. The other is to provide further confirmation, in this case derived from the behavior of authoritarian rulers, of how scholars have understood the drivers of cross-national diffusion. At the same time, however, we counsel students of diffusion to pay more attention to the role of resisters, as well as to adopters. In this sense, the geographical reach of diffusion is much broader than many analysts have recognized.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002107","753-768","Valerie J.

A key flaw in this literature, however, is that it is historically un-rooted, either dismissing or ignoring important analytical and empirical insights from presidential research and from APD and historical-institutionalist perspectives. In this article, I argue that we can better explain patterns and variations in the use of presidential emergency power by paying careful attention to shifting historical set points for executive choice and action during security crises. In particular, the findings here underscore the episodic growth of new precedents, resources, and expectations for the White House in perilous contexts. The development of presidential emergency power reflects the potential for early executive choices to be repeated and legitimated over time, laying dormant as a &#8220;loaded weapon&#8221; to be used by future executives in similarly urgent circumstances.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002132","769-788","Daniel J.

Among conservative and liberal groups, there is a vigorous debate over the terms used to describe this population, such as &#8220;undocumented&#8221; or &#8220;illegal,&#8221; as both sides perceive significant consequences to public opinion that flow out of this choice in equivalency frames. These same groups also compete over the ways in which immigration policies are framed. Here, for the first time, we examine the use of both types of frames (of immigrants themselves, and the policies affecting them) in media coverage. Importantly, we also test for whether these various frames affect preferences on three different policies of legalization. Our results suggest that efforts to focus on the terms used to describe immigrants have limited effect, and that efforts to frame policy offer greater promise in swaying public opinion on immigration.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002077","789-807","S.

While there is a clear link between a developed economy and democracy, the relationship is not self-evident in all cases. Also, economic growth is not conducive to the development of democracy under all circumstances, especially when the distribution of wealth is not considered fair by all citizens. In and of itself an election, even a competitive one&#8212;long considered a democratic minimum&#8212;does not guarantee the survival of a democracy, as strongmen have learned how to run an authoritarian system behind an electoral veil. The majority of autocratic leaders use the concept of democracy as a screen for building a political regime antithetical to the spirit and practice of a real democracy. Autocrats adopt a number of democratic institutions only to subvert their original purposes. While they pose as democrats, instead of a liberal democracy they initially organize a majoritarian democracy, followed by an illiberal democracy that ignores human rights. This is but one step away from an autocratic turning point, the rejection of all democratic principles. &#8220;Potemkin democracies&#8221; may even hold (limited) open elections organized so that the outcome will not threaten the foundations of the existing regime.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002053","841-851","Andr&#225;s Boz&#243;ki","Central European University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1211","532"

What is most intriguing in this particular book on Lebanon is not the complexity of the political order agreed to in 1989 but the unforeseen consequences of the initially praised new formula of power sharing as trust building. Counterintuitively, a fairer representation of distinct groups turns out to have harmed the public interest through a series of failures to ensure a transparent process of policymaking. Leenders offers a detailed account of the price Lebanon had to pay for the accommodation of social conflict, that is, institutional gridlocks and widespread misuse of state resources by politicians. The lessons implied in Spoils of Truce gain special importance now, when in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, constitutional engineers and practitioners engage in the building of new political institutions in many Middle Eastern and North African countries.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713001503","882-883","Tatiana Kostadinova","Florida International University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","425","67"

The global order they have built over two centuries&#8212;a system based on liberal democracy at home and free trade abroad&#8212;is meeting its demise, he warns. New nations have arisen that neither share the West's historical traditions nor aspire to its contemporary values. The advanced industrial West, Kupchan argues, cannot logically expect nations like China, India, Brazil, and Russia to voluntarily comply with an existing order that is alien to their experiences and unaccommodating to their interests. Nor can the West realistically strong-arm such nations. The fulcrum of relative power has shifted too far to make coercion possible. But the West, he asserts, must not stand idly by. Historically, power transitions&#8212;save for a few rare exceptions&#8212;have tended to engender violent conflict. This time will be no different, says the author, unless the West moves aggressively to foster a new and far more inclusive global order.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713001527","889-891","Edward S.

Taking right-wing (e.g., Carl Schmitt's Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy [1928]) as well as left-wing (e.g., Harold Laski's Democracy in Crisis [1931]) forms, that genre combined insights from the latest social scientific scholarship with perceptive and oftentimes prescient political observations. Although we now know that it too often understated liberalism's potential for reform and renewal, abandoning sound analysis for apocalyptic aper&#231;us, that literature sometimes creatively identified liberalism's own internal contradictions as the source of what was then frequently described as &#8220;the crisis of our times.&#8221;","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002041","893-895","William E.

It is certainly true that the crisis of liberalism in general and of the liberal world order in particular is not a new subject. Then why take it up again? For two reasons: first, many of the previous and contemporary critical analyses of the liberal world order tend to be prejudiced by theoretical and/or political convictions that serve to predetermine their view of the subject. I consider myself a skeptical liberal in the sense that the progress which most liberals talk about is possible and desirable, but it cannot be taken for granted and the obstacles to progress are much more serious than many liberals think.

Textbook renditions of realism emphasize the pursuit of national interest and the importance of Realpolitik, deny morality any meaningful role in international politics, and confirm the primacy of the sovereign nation-state and the fragility of international institutions. Realists look to the balance of power as the major instrument in preserving peace, and they reject the idea that anarchy can be transformed as a result of globalization and interstate cooperation, even in advanced cases of the latter, such as the European Union.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271300203X","895-897","Georg S&#248;rensen","University of Aarhus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","721","211"

Manning is a former U.S. Army intelligence analyst who covertly conveyed to WikiLeaks a massive file of over 700,000 classified documents&#8212;including battlefield reports from Iraq, reports from Afghanistan, and State Department cables&#8212;thereby publicly disclosing extensive information about U.S. military conduct, and misconduct, of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Manning was subjected to harsh treatment, including solitary confinement during the first nine months of his detention, sparking public outcry and leading a UN Special Rapporteur on Torture to hold that his detention represented cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271300279X","1007-1010","Jeffrey C.

Although many have dismissed these actors as terrorists, criminals, and troublemakers, we argue that such actors are emblematic of a new kind of political actor: extraordinary bandits (e-bandits) that engage in the politics of no one via anonymizing Internet technologies. Building on Hobsbawm&#39;s idea of the social bandit, we show how these actors fundamentally change the terms of global activism. First, as political actors, e-bandits are akin to Robin Hood, resisting the powers that be who threaten the desire to keep the Internet free, not through lobbying legislators, but by &#8220;taking&#8221; what has been deemed off limits. Second, e-banditry forces us to think about how technology changes &#8220;ordinary&#8221; transnational activism. Iconic images of street protests and massive marches often underlie the way we as scholars think about social movements and citizen action; they are ordinary ways we expect non-state actors to behave when they demand political change. E-bandits force us to understand political protest as virtual missives and actions, activity that leaves no physical traces but that has real-world consequences, as when home phone numbers and addresses of public officials are released. Finally, e-banditry is relatively open in terms of who participates, which contributes to the growing sense that activism has outgrown organizations as the way by which individuals connect. We illustrate our theory with the actions of two e-bandits, Anonymous and WikiLeaks.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002806","1015-1033","Peter A. Brown","University of Toronto","Wendy H.

This article explores the similarities and differences between the basing network and imperial systems. We argue that American basing practices and relations combine elements of liberal multilateralism with &#8220;neo-imperial&#8221; hegemony. Much, but far from all, of the network shares with ideal-typical empires a hub-and-spoke system of unequal relations among the United States and its base-host country &#8220;peripheries.&#8221; But Washington rarely exercises rule over host-country leaders and their constituents. Historical examples suggest that this combination of imperial and non-imperial elements has rendered the United States vulnerable to political cross-pressures, intermediary exits, and periodic bargaining failures when dealing with overseas base hosts. Moreover, globalizing processes, especially increasing information flows and the transnational networking of anti-base movements, further erode U.S. capacity to maintain multivocal legitimation strategies and keep the terms of its individual basing bargains isolated from one another. Case studies of the rapid contestation of the terms of the U.S. basing presence in post-Soviet Central Asia and post-2003 Iraq illustrate some of these dynamics.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002818","1034-1050","Alexander Cooley","Barnard College","Daniel H.

The canonical text of liberal political economy, Adam Smith&#39;s Wealth of Nations, is assumed even in the most progressive interpretations to accept inequality, rationalized as the inevitable trade-off for increasing prosperity compared to less developed but more equal economies. I argue instead that Smith&#39;s system, if fully implemented, would not allow steep inequalities to arise. In Smith, profits should be low and labor wages high, legislation in favor of the worker is &#8220;always just and equitable,&#8221; land should be distributed widely and evenly, inheritance laws liberalized, taxation can be high if it is equitable, and the science of the legislator is necessary to put the system in motion and keep it aligned. Market economies are made in Smith&#39;s system. Political theorists and economists have highlighted some of these points, but the counterfactual &#8220;what would the distribution of wealth be if all the building blocks were ever in place?&#8221; has not been posed. Doing so encourages us to question why steep inequality is accepted as a fact, instead of a pathology that the market economy was not supposed to generate in the first place.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271300282X","1051-1070","Deborah Boucoyannis","University of Virginia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3933","575"

The question now is whether these landmark reforms will be consolidated and create a new politics going forward. We develop an argument about the limits of policy feedback to illuminate the obstacles to durable liberal reform in the contemporary American state. We argue that political scientists have paid insufficient attention to the fragility of inherited policy commitments, and that the capacity of reforms to remake politics is contingent, conditional, and contested. Feedbacks are shaped not only by the internal attributes of policies, but also by the interaction between policy-specific characteristics, the strategic goals of officeholders and clientele groups, and the political forces arising from a contentious and uncertain political environment.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002831","1071-1087","Eric M.

Why States Consider and Adopt Restrictive Voter Access Policies","Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in state legislation likely to reduce access for some voters, including photo identification and proof of citizenship requirements, registration restrictions, absentee ballot voting restrictions, and reductions in early voting. Political operatives often ascribe malicious motives when their opponents either endorse or oppose such legislation. In an effort to bring empirical clarity and epistemological standards to what has been a deeply-charged, partisan, and frequently anecdotal debate, we use multiple specialized regression approaches to examine factors associated with both the proposal and adoption of restrictive voter access legislation from 2006&#8211;2011. Our results indicate that proposal and passage are highly partisan, strategic, and racialized affairs. These findings are consistent with a scenario in which the targeted demobilization of minority voters and African Americans is a central driver of recent legislative developments. We discuss the implications of these results for current partisan and legal debates regarding voter restrictions and our understanding of the conditions incentivizing modern suppression efforts. Further, we situate these policies within developments in social welfare and criminal justice policy that collectively reduce electoral access among the socially marginalized.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002843","1088-1116","Erin E.

Phronetic Social Science in Theory and Practice","Real Social Science: Applied Phronesis, edited by Bent Flyvbjerg, Todd Landman, and Sanford Schram, is an interesting read in the context of the current assault on both the scientific status and the practical utility of social science in general and political science specifically. In it, the editors collect examples of social scientific work that embrace what Flyvbjerg and others have described as phronetic social science. This approach makes creative use of the Aristotelian intellectual virtue of phronesis, or practical wisdom, which the editors identify with the knowledge of how to address and act on social problems in a particular context. Rather than emphasizing the universal truth (episteme) that has traditionally been the summum bonum of social scientific inquiry, or fixating on the know-how (techne) that is characteristic of methodologically driven approaches, Flyvbjerg, Landman, and Schram present examples of social scientific research where contextual knowledge, deep understanding of embedded power dynamics, and immediate relevance to political reality take center stage. In so doing they give the lie to those who would deny the practical relevance of social research. At the same time, however, the editors develop an understanding of phronesis that marginalizes valuable elements of Aristotle's understanding of the intellectual virtue, most notably its basis in self-examination, while simultaneously bringing phronesis much closer to techne by seeking to develop their phronetic social science along methodological lines.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002296","1139-1143","Edward W.

By Aaron Schneider. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012. 260p. $90.00.","After a long period waiting in the wings, the Fisc (the state treasury, or the larger system of public finance) has returned to center stage in comparative politics. During this time, fiscal sociologist Joseph Schumpeter was more likely to be cited for his &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; thesis, than for his &#8220;crisis of the tax state&#8221; analysis. While the &#8220;return to the state&#8221; dates back to the late 1970s, it still took another decade before taxation became a monograph headliner, with influential works by Margaret Levi (Of Rule and Revenue, 1988), Charles Tilly (Coercion, Capital and European States: AD 990&#8211;1992, 1992) and Sven Steinmo (Taxation and Democracy: Swedish, British and American Approaches to Financing the Modern State, 1996). Since then, tax policy and extractive capacity have increasingly come to be recognized by comparativists as central to state-building projects, thus confirming Edmund Burke's old adage that &#8220;the revenue of the state is the state.&#8221; As part of this fiscal revival in comparative politics, Aaron Schneider has rightfully earned the status as leading expert on Central America with his new book, State-Building and Tax Regimes in Central America.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002892","1144-1146","Gerald M.

I address each in turn. As noted, contemporary elites share many characteristics with traditional elites, who are accurately described as incestuous, exclusive, and self-perpetuating. Some of the newly emerging elites are indeed drawn from the very families and networks that produced prior generations of elites. This evolution has been usefully described in ethnographic work by Central Americans such as Marta Casa&#250;s Arz&#250; and North Americans such as Jeffrey Paige. They note that despite continuities, there are important differences in contemporary elites, perhaps because of the democratic regimes in which they operate, and especially because of their location atop transnationally integrated production processes. Still, while this structural position produces both conflicts and coincidences of interest with traditional elite actors, the precise pattern of intraelite relations is the outcome of contingent social processes captured by the dimensions of cohesion and dominance. Different combinations of cohesion and dominance in intraelite relations serve as a useful beginning to the analysis of tax-regime outcomes.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002879","1146-1146","Aaron Schneider","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","424","48"

Gerald Easter has provided a comprehensively researched and grippingly written account of how these twin tests were met in Poland and Russia. To summarize the argument of this book, Polish state actors encountered a private sector of petty capitalists and workers, and their interaction struck a consensual bargain over tax powers, citizen obligations, and the nature of public benefits in a &#8220;contractual state.&#8221; By contrast, the Russian economy was dominated by large-scale extractive industries available only through elite bargains imposed with coercive authority in a &#8220;predatory state.&#8221; The contrast serves to demonstrate the gradual accretion of political struggles and institutional forms, diverse varieties of tax regimes, and the contribution to our understanding of state&#8212;society relations made by the postcommunist experience, where &#8220;the flow of power ran from state to society, rather than in the opposite direction&#8221; (p. 187).","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592713002491","1146-1148","Aaron Schneider","University of Denver","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","454","55"

We have done this because these themes resound throughout the current political world. Economist and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz nicely summed up this state of affairs in a November 4, 2011 column circulated by Project Syndicate: &#8220;The protest movement that began in Tunisia in January, subsequently spreading to Egypt, and then to Spain, has now become global, with the protests engulfing Wall Street and cities across America. Globalization and modern technology now enable social movements to transcend borders as rapidly as ideas can. And social protest has found fertile ground everywhere: a sense that the &#8216;system&#8217; has failed, and the conviction that even in a democracy, the electoral process will not set things right&#8212;at least not without strong pressure from the street.&#8221; The Occupy movement that spread like wildfire throughout the US, and that asserted itself on some major US university campuses, is simply the latest iteration of this diffusion of protest in which young people from Athens and Madrid to Cairo and Damascus seem to be playing a crucial role.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711004956","1-4","Jeffrey C.

Democracy is a subject that crosses the boundaries in political science, and within my own field of political theory there has been a major revival of democratic theory. In political theory, argument about &#8220;democracy&#8221; is usually now qualified by one of an array of adjectives, which include cosmopolitan, agonistic, republican, and monitory. But the new form that has been by far the most successful is deliberative democracy. By 2007 John Dryzek could write that &#8220;deliberative democracy now constitutes the most active area of political theory in its entirety (not just democratic theory).&#8221; Not only is there an extremely large and rapidly growing literature, both theoretical and empirical, on deliberative democracy, but its influence has spread far outside universities.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711004877","7-19","Carole Pateman","University of California, Los Angeles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10447","3495"

In advanced industrial democracies, by contrast, informal institutions often remain consigned to the analytic margins. This article makes a case for greater attention to informal political institutions in established democracies, and it introduces a theoretical framework to support such analysis. Informal institutions, understood as the unwritten rules of political life, are seen to perform three functions: they complete or fill gaps in formal institutions, coordinate the operation of overlapping (and perhaps clashing) institutions, and operate parallel to formal institutions in regulating political behavior. These three roles of informal institutions are associated with different characteristic patterns of institutional stability and change. The article illustrates its theoretical framework with case studies from American politics, the subfield in which formal-institutional analysis has flourished most. These cases are the historical norm of a two-term presidency (a completing institution), the unwritten rules of the presidential nomination process (coordinating institutions), the informal practice of obstruction in the Senate (a parallel institution), and the normative expectation that presidents should address the public directly (which performs all three functions).' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711004890","37-55","Julia R.

Barack Obama and the New American Party System","Ascending to the presidency in the midst of a severe economic crisis and an ongoing war on terrorism, Barack Obama faced numerous political and policy challenges. We examine the responsibilities he faced in assuming the received tasks of modern presidential leadership amid a polarized political system. To a point, Obama has embraced partisan leadership, indeed, even further articulating developments in the relationship between the president and parties that Ronald Reagan had first initiated, and George W. Bush built upon. Thus Obama has advanced an executive-centered party system that relies on presidential candidates and presidents to pronounce party doctrine, raise campaign funds, mobilize grassroots support, and campaign on behalf of their partisan brethren. Just as Reagan and Bush used their powers in ways that bolstered their parties, so Obama&#39;s exertions have strengthened the Democratic Party&#39;s capacity to mobilize voters and to advance programmatic objectives. At the same time, presidential partisanship threatens to relegate collective responsibility to executive aggrandizement. Seeking to avoid the pitfalls that undermined the Bush presidency, Obama has been more ambivalent about uniting partisanship and executive power. Only time will tell whether this ambiguity proves to be effective statecraft&#8212;enshrining his charisma in an enduring record of achievement and a new Democratic majority&#8212;or whether it marks a new stage in the development of executive dominion that subordinates party building to the cult of personality.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711004907","57-76","Jesse H.

Among academics, heated theoretical debates exist over whether such policies foster or hinder immigrants&#39; engagement with their adoptive nation. We provide a novel empirical assessment of this debate from the immigrant perspective. We ask how multicultural and citizenship policies influence immigrants&#39; socio-political engagement with their adoptive nation in three realms: social inclusion, political inclusion, and political engagement. Using a variety of cross-national and single-country surveys, we show that multiculturalism in no case hinders engagement with society and government, and in many cases seems to foster it. Thus, the claim that multiculturalism undermines immigrants&#39; socio-political integration appears largely without foundation.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711004919","77-95","Irene Bloemraad","University of California, Berkeley, and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.

It is careful and thoughtful, and I especially appreciate the important criticisms he raises. On Rome, I fully concur that the scholarship in the &#8220;democratic school&#8221; raises important interpretative challenges. But I must confess to being more persuaded by the compelling work of Karl-Joachim H&#246;lkeskamp, Kurt Raaflaub, Robert Morstein-Marx, and especially Henrik Mouritsen than the admittedly influential authors McCormick cites. Fergus Millar and others have been criticized for their overly constitutional approach and relying perhaps too heavily on democratic discourse. Emphasizing factors like scale, place, and how power was exercised in actual practice, Mouritsen counters that the involvement of the poor&#8212;the vast majority&#8212;in the political affairs of Rome was exceedingly limited. At the contiones, &#8220;the people&#8221; were present more as a political concept than physically in attendance. The capacity of the comitium was at most 4,000 people for a demos of some five million citizens&#8212;who were themselves a privileged minority among tens of millions of non-citizens and slaves. The heavy time demands of direct democracy on these citizens trying to eke out a living would have been a major burden. Whatever democracy really meant or achieved in Rome (and Athens), it clearly did not aid the lower classes materially. There was a steady accumulation of wealth and power upward toward oligarchs as debt and poverty worsened among the plebs.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711005263","139-140","Jeffrey A.

Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and John Yoo as torturers, or indict the heads of financial institutions for the crimes that triggered economic ruin in 2008. Consider how different American democracy might be if its governing institutions included a body of and for the plebs, empowered to veto one major piece of legislation a year (perhaps the recent extension of the Bush tax cuts) or oversee an annual national referendum (maybe on a single-payer health insurance plan).","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711004300","140-143","Jeffrey A.

Debates about citizens' ability to act as a check on government behavior are not new, of course, and have a long tradition in political philosophy and in public discourse. Yet the proliferation of theories of domestic&#8211;international linkages in contemporary IR scholarship has unfortunately been accompanied by incomplete dialogue between public opinion and IR scholars and often by claims of unidirectional or unconditional causality regarding domestic constraints, elite framing and opinion leadership, citizens' informational capacities, and the role of the media. The relationship among these factors in shaping foreign policy is quite complex, however, and fortunately Thomas Knecht acknowledges this complexity and advances a conditional argument about the relationship between public attitudes and presidential decision making.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711004282","145-146","Terrence L.

Chapman","Why do states go through the trouble of seeking authorization from multilateral institutions to use military force when they are not required to do so? How do states choose the international organization through which to work? Why do citizens sometimes demand a multilateral response to an international crisis, yet at other times seem content when their leaders act unilaterally? Terrence Chapman takes up these questions in his persuasive and important book Securing Approval. The answer, he says, is domestic politics. Using a game-theoretic approach supported by a wealth of empirical evidence, Chapman shows that international organizations (IOs) provide important information to domestic publics. This information can affect public opinion and, by extension, foreign policy. A short review does not do justice to this nuanced and smart book. Nevertheless, I will outline the author's central argument before discussing the book's contribution to the literature. I conclude by raising three issues that might serve as avenues for future research.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711004270","147-149","Thomas Knecht","Westmont College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","588","94"

The book has received much critical attention (which will indeed be the topic of future discussion in Perspectives). It is undeniably true that recent decades have seen a decrease in the incidence of, and casualties related to, classic forms of interstate violence, and that in recent years there has been a decline in organized civil war violence as well. At the same time, it is equally true that violence&#8212;its threat, its use, its many often-unpredictable consequences&#8212;remains an ever-present part of the political landscape throughout the world. The Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development's recent report, The Global Burden of Armed Violence 2011, estimates that since 2004 &#8220;more than 526,000 people are killed each year as a result of lethal violence.&#8221; The report estimates that only around one tenth of these killings&#8212;approximately 55,000 per year&#8212;are caused by &#8220;direct armed conflict,&#8221; i.e., in organized wars, whether interstate or civil. But it also estimates that hundreds of thousands more are related to gang violence, drug trafficking, transnational organized crime, and other activities that take place in a netherworld beyond law and order, and between &#8220;war&#8221; and &#8220;peace.&#8221; And it observes that while the categories typically used by governments, multilateral agencies, and NGOs to classify violence&#8212;organized vs. interpersonal, conflict-related vs. criminal&#8212;serve certain practical purposes, &#8220;these distinctions give the misleading impression that different forms and incidents of violence fit into neat and separate categories,&#8221; whereas in fact these forms of violence are not so neatly distinguished. And beyond the sphere of lethal violence lays a much broader domain of destruction, fear, insecurity, vulnerability, and harm.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000783","235-241","Jeffrey C.

This fascinating mix of conflict and cooperation shapes patterns of politics, governance, and violence. Building on recent findings about state formation, I offer a conceptual typology of political orders amidst civil war. Wartime political orders vary according to the distribution of territorial control and the level of cooperation between states and insurgents. Orders range from collusion and shared sovereignty to spheres of influence and tacit coexistence to clashing monopolies and guerrilla disorder. Examples from contemporary South Asian conflicts illustrate these concepts, which are scalable and portable across contexts. Scholars need to think more creatively about the political-military arrangements that emerge and evolve during war. A key policy implication is that there are many ways of forging stability without creating a counterinsurgent Leviathan.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000655","243-264","Paul Staniland","University of Chicago.

The internal politics of non-state groups have received increasing attention, with recent research demonstrating the importance of cohesion and fragmentation for understanding conflict dynamics. Yet there is little consensus on how to conceptualize fragmentation, the concept at the center of this agenda, with authors using different definitions and measures. In this paper we conceptualize fragmentation along three constitutive dimensions: the number of organizations in the movement; the degree of institutionalization across these organizations; and the distribution of power among them. We then show how variation across these dimensions can explain variation in important conflict processes, focusing on infighting.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000667","265-283","Kathleen Gallagher Cunningham","University of Maryland and Peace Research Oslo Institute","Lee J.

Most current research on these topics either explicitly or implicitly separates the two, in spite of compelling reasons to consider them together. In this paper, we examine the extent to which terrorism and civil war overlap and then unpack various temporal and spatial patterns. To accomplish this, we use newly geo-referenced terror event data to offer a global overview of where and when terrorist events happen and whether they occur inside or outside of civil war zones. Furthermore, we conduct an exploratory analysis of six separate cases that have elements of comparability but also occur in unique contexts, which illustrate some of the patterns in terrorism and civil war. The data show a high degree of overlap between terrorism and ongoing civil war and, further, indicate that a substantial amount of terrorism occurs prior to civil wars in Latin America, but yet follows civil war in other regions of the world. While the study of terrorism and of civil war mostly occurs in separate scholarly communities, we argue for more work that incorporates insights from each research program and we offer a possibility for future research by considering how geo-referenced terror and civil war data may be utilized together. More generally, we expect these results to apply to a wide variety of attitudes and behaviors in contentious politics.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000679","285-305","Michael G.

This article outlines a research agenda that analyzes the conditions under which genocide is likely to occur, the multilevel processes of violent escalation and de-escalation, and the ways in which these processes are shaped by, connect to, reinforce, accelerate and impede one another. I argue that scholars should 1) model elite and follower radicalization processes by disaggregating genocidal &#8220;intent&#8221; over time and space, and exploring how intent emerges rather than taking it as pre-given. Doing so will permit researchers to 2) situate genocide research within a broader context of political violence in order to understand how they are related temporally and spatially, and to decenter analytical domains beyond the standard country level and single victim group in order to gain insight into the dynamics of genocide, including how perpetrator policies vary by group; 3) draw on recent advances in microanalyses of civil war to theorize about subnational patterns of violence diffusion; 4) move beyond problematic contrasts between ideology and rationality to analyze how ideologies frame the strategic choices &#8220;available&#8221; to genocidal elites.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000680","307-321","Ernesto Verdeja","University of Notre Dame.

When political scientists have approached the subject, the trend has been to treat the Holocaust as a single case, comparing it&#8212;sometimes controversially&#8212;with other instances of genocide such as Rwanda or Cambodia. But historically grounded work on the destruction of European Jewry can help illuminate the microfoundations of violent politics, unpack the relationship between a ubiquitous violence-inducing ideology (antisemitism) and highly variable murder, and recast old questions about the origins and evolution of the Holocaust itself. After reviewing new trends in history-writing, I highlight opportunities for social-scientifically oriented research centered on the interaction of state power, local communities, and violent mobilization in five areas: military occupation, repertoires of violence, alliance politics, genocidal policymaking, and resistance. My conclusion addresses thorny issues of comparison, morality, and memory.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000692","323-341","Charles King","Georgetown University.

Much of the existing theory on genocide focuses on explaining under what conditions and by what processes regimes commit large-scale violence against civilians. I argue that a critical missing dimension to studies of genocide, but also more generally to the study of political violence, is a methodological recognition of negative cases and a theoretical recognition of the dynamics of restraint that helps to explain such negative cases. That is, in addition to asking what causes leaders to choose to escalate violence, I argue that scholars should emphasize conditions that prompt moderation, de-escalation, or non-escalation. I propose an alternative framework for how to conceptualize the process of political violence and review the literature to identify key restraint mechanisms at micro, meso, and macro levels of analysis. I further articulate a provisional theory of genocide using this new analytical framework. I illustrate my argument with an empirical analysis of mass violence cases in Sub-Saharan Africa since independence, and with a more in-depth analysis of comparable crises in Rwanda and C&#244;te d&#39;Ivoire, where the trajectories of violence differed significantly. While this paper draws on extensive empirical research, my primary purpose is not to advance a developed new theory or to test particular hypotheses, but rather to outline a research agenda that promises to draw from and contribute to recent work on the comparative politics of violence.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000709","343-362","Scott Straus","University of Wisconsin, Madison.

In order to play a constructive role in this quickly changing setting, political scientists need to invent a new identity for themselves as active practitioners engaged in a dynamic dialogue with students and policymakers.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712000722","385-396","Lisa Anderson","American University in Cairo (AUC), Egypt.

This theoretical stance contrasts with currently dominant theories, which view parties as controlled by election-minded politicians. The difference is normatively important because parties dominated by interest groups and activists are less responsive to voter preferences, even to the point of taking advantage of lapses in voter attention to politics. Our view is consistent with evidence from the formation of national parties in the 1790s, party position change on civil rights and abortion, patterns of polarization in Congress, policy design and nominations for state legislatures, Congress, and the presidency.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712001624","571-597","Kathleen Bawn","UCLA, <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:kbawn@polisci.ucla.edu>kbawn@polisci.ucla.edu</span>","John Zaller","UCLA, <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:zaller@ucla.edu>zaller@ucla.edu</span>","Martin Cohen","James Madison University, <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:martycohen17@gmail.com>martycohen17@gmail.com</span>","Hans Noel","Georgetown University, <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:hcn4@georgetown.edu>hcn4@georgetown.edu</span>","Seth Masket","University of Denver, <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:seth.masket@du.edu>seth.masket@du.edu</span>","David Karol","University of Maryland, College Park, <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:dkarol@umd.edu>dkarol@umd.edu</span>","","","","","","","","","7601","2104"

Pitkin&#39;s core insight into democratic representation is that democratic representation is &#8220;quasi-performative&#8221;: an activity that mobilizes constituencies by the interests it claims in their name. I develop this insight together with its implications for contemporary scholarship on the political effects of economic equality. I conclude by arguing that the fundamental democratic deficiency of the US political system goes much deeper than its disproportionate responsiveness to wealthy interests; it is a matter of system biases that foster the formation and expression of those interests, while mitigating against mobilization by those Americans who want inequality to be reduced.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712001636","599-616","Lisa Disch","University of Michigan, <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:ldisch@umich.edu>ldisch@umich.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2432","813"

In particular, we suggest that it should engage in more active dialogue with the combined insights offered by principal-agent theory and what we refer to as state theory. More specifically, in the framework we develop, the principal-agent framework offers the analytical tools for analyzing leadership behavior at the micro level, while state theory provides crucial insights regarding the macro-level factors shaping leadership behavior.

The paper discusses the significance of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 in accelerating efforts to devolve and privatize emergency management functions; the reorganization of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a service purchaser and arranger; and the efforts by the New Orleans city government to contract out disaster recovery activities to private firms. I situate and explain these three developments in the context of recent trends toward the neoliberalization of state activities, including the privatization and devolution of policy implementation to private firms and non-governmental organizations. On both the federal and local levels, inadequate contract oversight and lack of cost controls provided opportunities for private contractors to siphon public resources and exploit government agencies to further their profiteering interests and accumulation agendas. This article demonstrates how the privatization of emergency management services and policy constitutes a new regulatory project in which the state&#39;s role has shifted away from providing aid to disaster victims and toward the management and coordination of services delivered by private contractors.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271200165X","633-646","Kevin Fox Gotham","School of Liberal Arts, Tulane University, New Orleans, <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:kgotham@tulane.edu>kgotham@tulane.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2313","756"

Three demographic changes warrant new analyses: the decline of non-Hispanic whites in most large cities, the variety of non-Anglo groups and immigrants across cities, and regional variations in the racially-inflected dependency ratio. Each demographic change generates political and scholarly controversies: are cities becoming less segregated? Is black politics a useful template for studying the politics of other groups? Is the dependency ratio more likely to exacerbate or ameliorate group conflict?

Many would consider such a claim weak, noting each event's unique scale and relationship to the politics of race in the US. Yet I argue that that the events are in fact closely linked in fundamental ways that are important not only to political scientists, but, more importantly, to all who care about the health of democracy within the US. Each event demonstrates the massive racial cleavages within the US. Each event illustrates the nature of evolving racial order in the US. Each event illustrates the weaknesses and problems that confront contemporary black politics. And each event thus illuminates key questions that should motivate theoretical and empirical work on race and politics within political science. In this essay, I highlight the themes and processes that tie together these seemingly disparate events, some marked by hope, others by despair. I start by analyzing each event from the standpoint of the persistent, if evolving, racial divide in American public opinion. And I end by arguing that scholars of race and politics often have to adhere to the most rigorous scholarly standards while also fulfilling their duties as citizens.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712001685","669-673","Michael C.

We are concerned with how the seen and the not seen have influenced the ways the purported tabula rasa of New Orleans has been (re)constructed and marked since 2005. We engage with recent debates in political science about power, agency, structure, and culpability, arguing that efforts to prioritize the pursuit of culpability over critique in power analyses, such as the approach advocated by Steven Lukes, risk perpetuating structural violence. We employ the concepts of an ocular ethic and social triage to understand why the storm of the century that was supposed to reveal all has in the end left much concealed, with shocking levels of human devastation unaddressed.

Despite its ease of access, and close proximity to the more famous cemeteries to which tourists regularly make pilgrimage, the memorial is little visited and largely unknown, even to many of the city's own residents. In this it stands in stark contrast to the National September 11 Memorial in Lower Manhattan, which drew its millionth visitor less than four months after its opening on September 12, 2011. Recent work in political theory on memory, mourning, and memorialization&#8212;as well as Ancient Greek concerns about the same&#8212;point to the ways in which the manner of remembrance, grieving, and commemoration employed by a democratic polity help to shape political outcomes. In what follows, I trace the history and design of the New York City and New Orleans memorials to suggest the ways in which they embody and perpetuate national strategies of remembrance and forgetting, in which injustices perpetrated against the polity are prioritized over injustices perpetrated within it. Drawing on John Bodnar's distinction between national and vernacular commemoration, I nevertheless conclude with a counter-intuitive suggestion: that while on a national level the public's relative ignorance of the Katrina Memorial is indeed indicative of a polity more concerned with injustices perpetrated against it than within it; on a local level the erection and subsequent forgetting of the Katrina Memorial is a manifestation of a mode of vernacular memory, mourning and commemoration with far more democratically-productive potential than its counterpart in New York City. In particular, I argue that it cultivates, and historically has cultivated, a more forward-looking, progressive, and polyphonic response to loss than the type of dominant national narratives embodied by the 9/11 Memorial. Whereas the latter continually replays the loss in ways that rob the polity of its capacity to move beyond its initial response, the former acknowledges and incorporates the loss while steeling the community for the challenges ahead.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712001703","687-700","Simon Stow","Department of Government, The College of William and Mary, <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:sastow@wm.edu>sastow@wm.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1337","305"

By S. Laurel Weldon. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 2011. 244p. $65.00 cloth, $27.95 paper.","Because social movements exist to challenge entrenched power structures or change prevailing social practices, they claim to represent marginalized or excluded constituencies. Yet as eloquently argued by E. E. Schattschneider, &#8220;the flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper-class accent&#8221; (The Semisovereign People, 1960, 35). Lacking formal mechanisms of democratic accountability, social movements, like other organized interests, can fall prey to the trap of overrepresenting the privileged. In addition, some scholars have challenged the idea that movements have any durable influence. Even if we believe that movements represent the excluded, what value do they have if their influence is fleeting? These questions problematize the democratic value of social movements and raise questions about the value of protest in shaping policy that affects marginalized interests. Are movements effective pathways to greater democratic inclusiveness, or do they reinforce existing power structures?","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712001090","787-789","Hahrie C.

In the book, I develop some distinctions between types of groups and types of issues as a way of answering these questions, arguing that social movements are especially important for social change issues (called &#8220;progressive&#8221; policy issues in more recent work) and for giving voice to systematically disadvantaged (or marginalized) groups.

How is it, Hahrie Han asks, that a large, underresourced population returned to New Orleans against great odds to vote in a mayoral election? Han problematizes the received wisdom about political participation, bringing new attention to the seemingly intractable problem of political inequality in the United States. How did these people manage to come from out of town, many of them busing in and out on the same day, to vote in a municipal election? If we find the answer to this question, we may discover new ways to expand political participation in the United States, particularly among those populations that seem to be the most difficult to pull into the democratic decision-making process.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712001089","789-792","S.

Our two books share a common interest in investigating the mechanisms through which marginalized constituencies gain voice in politics. While my book takes a micro, individual perspective, focusing on questions about participation in American politics, Weldon's takes a macro perspective, analyzing the impact of social movements and movement organizations in a comparative context.

This is odd, not least because each literature has always (consciously or less so) borne the problems of the other literature in mind. Much of the literature on republicanism has been undertaken with the idea of explaining the ideational roots of modern Anglo-American institutions (Eric Nelson on republicanism more generally, Karen Orren on contracts and labor arrangements, Jeremy Waldron on legislatures), or with eliciting the programmatic and ethical conclusions to which the philosophy underlying our institutions should lead us (Philip Pettit, Michael Sandel, Waldron again). And as scholars of American legislatures, agencies, and courts continue to document exhaustively the factual behavior of those institutions, many have begun to turn to the matches and mismatches between theoretical promise and institutional realities (Lawrence Jacobs and Robert Shapiro, Richard Hall, Diana Mutz, and most recently Lawrence Lessig). Yet with some very recent exceptions&#8212;among them John McCormick's Machiavellian Democracy (2011) and Ira Katznelson's forthcoming volume, Fear Itself, on Congress and American liberalism&#8212;the conversation lacks synthetic treatments that take up the themes of both literatures in the same volume.

Hiring and Firing Public Officials achieves those rare pairings by methodically pursuing an academic coup. Justin Buchler aims to replace electoral theory's dominant &#8220;market paradigm&#8221;&#8212;whose pioneers include Joseph Schumpeter (Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, 1942) and Anthony Downs (An Economic Model of Democracy, 1957)&#8212;with a more accurate &#8220;employment model,&#8221; and to defend that new model against all manner of attack. Buchler prosecutes his goals doggedly, repetitively, and quite effectively. The result is an intelligent, important new book that may not dazzle but will challenge settled convictions and change more than a few minds. The author's occasionally defensive tone is understandable given the nature of his ambition. His book advocates paradigmatic revolution and, to borrow from Mao Zedong, revolution is not a dinner party.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712001430","803-805","Ben Berger","Swarthmore College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","671","68"

Everyone knows we need more civic engagement&#8212;everyone, that is, except Ben Berger, whose willingness to argue against convention, particularly when that convention is a key tenet of good governmentism, makes me reflexively sympathetic to his argument. Berger and I both attack foundational assumptions of conventional democratic thought, but we differ in our approaches. I base my arguments on economic theory and quantitative analysis, whereas he bases his arguments primarily on interpretations of canonical theorists, most importantly Hannah Arendt and Alexis de Tocqueville. Ultimately, I am convinced by Berger's argument that civic engagement is a messy concept that cannot be considered an &#8220;intrinsic good&#8221; for democracy, but like most formal theorists, I needed little convincing because the debate that he characterizes is remarkably similar to one that game theorists held some years ago, and resolved in the same direction.

This debate has been heavily influenced by the East Asian development model, where authoritarianism has often gone hand in hand with high growth rates. In South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, development has been propelled by authoritarian or semidemocratic regimes. One key element of this argument is that the repression of labor under these authoritarian regimes has been especially helpful in states' pursuit of high growth rates because it has ensured political stability and checked societal demands.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712001119","809-811","Erik Martinez Kuhonta","McGill University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","702","71"

He argues that an institutionalized party helps to promote social and human development by privileging public over private interests and by promoting programmatic politics rather than clientelistic exchange. A party is fully institutionalized when it is autonomous, coherent, and organizationally complex, but is rooted in society in a way that enables it to address the needs of the poor (pp. 23&#8211;24). To test his argument, Kuhonta draws on evidence from two sets of paired comparisons.

While one conclusion that emerges from the study is that illiberal regimes (Malaysia and Vietnam) have done better than liberal regimes (Thailand and the Philippines), I do not argue that illiberalism is a necessary variable for equitable development. The record across the developing world shows that many authoritarian regimes have very dismal economic outcomes.

It is a compelling demand, for citizens and elites who rally beneath the banner of &#8220;democracy&#8221; and for political scientists who study the ways citizens and elites rally beneath banners in order to mobilize, seek, and contest political power. The force of this demand was captured by the cover of our June 2011 issue, which featured a wall in Egypt's Tahrir Square covered with graffiti stating that &#8220;Mubarak must go&#8221; and calling for &#8220;freedom&#8221; and &#8220;democracy.&#8221;","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712002848","863-866","Jeffrey C.

Recent scholarship on authoritarianism suggests that ruling parties enhance elite cohesion&#8212;and consequently, regime durability&#8212;by providing institutionalized access the spoils of power. We argue, by contrast, that while elite access to power and spoils may ensure elite cooperation during normal times, it often fails to do so during crises. Instead, the identities, norms, and organizational structures forged during periods of sustained, violent, and ideologically-driven conflict are a critical source of cohesion&#8212;and durability&#8212;in party-based authoritarian regimes. Origins in violent conflict raise the cost of defection and provide leaders with additional (non-material) resources that can be critical to maintaining unity and discipline, even when a crisis threatens the party&#39;s hold on power. Hence, where ruling parties combine mechanisms of patronage distribution with the strong identities, solidarity ties, and discipline generated by violent origins, regimes should be most durable.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712002861","869-889","Steven R.

To test whether the political promise of economic liberalization and the logic of modernization that underlies it hold true, I draw on existing and original data on privatization, pluralism, and opposition movements throughout the region from early independence to the present. The data reveal a fundamentally different formulation of the relationship between economics and politics than that found in the standard causal account. Contrary to approaches that stress the &#8220;the primacy of economics&#8221; in determining political outcomes, numerous cases of post-Soviet capitalist defection to the political opposition clearly point to &#8220;the primacy of politics&#8221;: the tangible ways that formal and informal institutions structure economic opportunities and ultimately impinge on individual calculations to comply with, oppose, or seek refuge from the regime.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271200285X","891-916","Barbara Junisbai","Pitzer College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1480","584"

I seek to uncover the causal mechanisms that help account for these striking parallels. Drawing on my recent analysis of 1848, I argue that contention spread so quickly because many people in a wide range of countries drew rash inferences from the downfall of Tunisia&#39;s dictator. Applying cognitive heuristics that psychologists have documented, they overrated the significance of the Tunisian success, overestimated the similarities with the political situation in their own country, and jumped to the conclusion that they could successfully challenge their own autocrats. This precipitation prompted protests in many settings that actually were much less propitious; therefore problems abounded. Cognitive shortcuts held such sway because Arab societies were weakly organized and repressed and thus lacked leaders from whom common people could take authoritative cues. The decision whether to engage in emulative contention fell to ordinary citizens, who&#8212;due to limited information access and scarce experience&#8212;were especially susceptible to the simple inferences suggested by cognitive heuristics.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712002873","917-934","Kurt Weyland","University of Texas at Austin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","7917","4300"

Focusing on MMR that combines some type of qualitative analysis with statistical or formal approaches, we demonstrate that error-reduction and cross-validation are not feasible where methods are not sufficiently similar in their basic ontologies and their conceptions of causality. In such cases, MMR may still yield important benefits&#8212;such as uncovering related insights or improving the coding of variables&#8212;but these can be readily obtained through collaboration among scholars specializing in single-method research (SMR). Such scholars often set the standards for the application of particular methods and produce distinctive insights that can elude researchers concerned about competently deploying different methods and producing coherent findings. Thus, the unchecked proliferation of multi-method skill sets risks forefeiting the benefits of SMR and marginalizing idiographically-oriented qualitative research that fits less well with formal or quantitative approaches. This would effectively subvert the pluralism that once gave impetus to MMR unless disciplinary expectations and professional rewards are predicated on a more balanced and nuanced understanding of what various forms of SMR and MMR bring to the table.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712002836","935-953","Amel Ahmed","University of Massachusetts at Amherst","Rudra Sil","University of Pennsylvania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2617","981"

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011. 304p. $99.00.In recent years, social scientific research on nonviolent resistance has burgeoned. Yet many studies focus on the factors associated with nonviolent movements' success or failure. In her book, Wendy Pearlman poses different questions. Instead of asking when and how nonviolence works, she asks why some activists choose nonviolent tactics while others choose violent ones. Additionally, she asks why movements may, over time, shift between armed and unarmed strategies.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712002617","993-995","Sharon Erickson Nepstad","University of New Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","664","229"

Green investigates Speakers' purposive goals, tactical options, and legislative influence. The overriding thesis: Speakers' actions do not simply reflect &#8220;the majority of the majority's&#8221; interests and preferences, but rather emerge from a more diverse set of goals. As Green argues: &#8220;Speakers may exercise legislative leadership on behalf of the preferences of others besides the majority party in Congress [including] representing his or her own district &#8230; achieving his or her own preferred policy outcome &#8230; helping the party's president, the institutional presidency, or the House as a whole&#8221; (p. 17).","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712002332","999-1000","Matthew N.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010. 194p. $99.00 cloth, $26.99 paper.The American president is many things. He serves as the head of state, chief of his political party, manager of the national bureaucracy, commander of the armed forces, and even (to some at least) a moral leader of the country. But one of the most important roles of the president is legislative leader: setting the nation's policy agenda, proposing new bills, and steering key initiatives through Congress. The central nature of that role is evidenced by our tendency to think of past presidents in terms of their trademark policy proposals, be it Harry &#8220;Fair Deal&#8221; Truman or Ronald Reagan's &#8220;Reaganomics.&#8221;","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712002356","1001-1002","Matthew N.

My hope was that tracing the White House's lobbying strategies would not only reveal how they are intended to work but also offer a better blueprint for assessing if they do. To those ends, I theorized that the White House has two basic lobbying strategies&#8212;an early game (agenda-centered) strategy aimed at shaping the legislative alternatives considered and an endgame (vote-centered) strategy aimed at determining which prevailed. Tests with a diverse assortment of original data&#8212;on the practice of lobbying, the results of key roll-call votes, and the passage of new laws&#8212;all corroborated a key point: presidential coalition building operates differently than scholars have thought, with effects greater than previously realized.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592712002368","1002-1003","Matthew N.

John Boehner, the leader of the incoming House Republican majority, declared that the Republicans will dissolve the House Select Committee on Global Warming, established in 2007 to provide a forum for discussion of climate change issues. Boehner, like most of the Republican leadership, has long denied the urgency of climate change. In April 2009, as a guest on ABC's &#8220;This Week with George Stephanopoulos,&#8221; he notoriously compared carbon dioxide emissions to cow flatulence, asserting: &#8220;George, the idea that carbon dioxide is a carcinogen that is harmful to our environment is almost comical. Every time we exhale, we exhale carbon dioxide. Every cow in the world, you know, when they do what they do, you've got more carbon dioxide.&#8221;<p class='Dates'>(Online publication March 15 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710004056","1-5","Jeffrey C.

Instead, there is a regime complex: a loosely-coupled set of specific regimes. We describe the regime complex for climate change and seek to explain it, using interest-based, functional, and organizational arguments. This institutional form is likely to persist; efforts to build a comprehensive regime are unlikely to succeed, but experiments abound with narrower institutions focused on particular aspects of the climate change problem. Building on this analysis, we argue that a climate change regime complex, if it meets specified criteria, has advantages over any politically feasible comprehensive regime. Adaptability and flexibility are particularly important in a setting&#8212;such as climate change policy&#8212;in which the most demanding international commitments are interdependent yet governments vary widely in their interest and ability to implement them. Yet in view of the serious political constraints, both domestic and international, there is little reason for optimism that the climate regime complex that is emerging will lead to reductions in emissions rapid enough to meet widely discussed goals, such as stopping global warming at two degrees above pre-industrial levels.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710004068","7-23","David G.

Untethered from recent GOP baggage and policy specifics, the Tea Party energized disgruntled white middle-class conservatives and garnered widespread attention, despite stagnant or declining favorability ratings among the general public. As participant observation and interviews with Massachusetts activists reveal, Tea Partiers are not monolithically hostile toward government; they distinguish between programs perceived as going to hard-working contributors to US society like themselves and &#8220;handouts&#8221; perceived as going to unworthy or freeloading people. During 2010, Tea Party activism reshaped many GOP primaries and enhanced voter turnout, but achieved a mixed record in the November general election. Activism may well continue to influence dynamics in Congress and GOP presidential primaries. Even if the Tea Party eventually subsides, it has undercut Obama&#39;s presidency, revitalized conservatism, and pulled the national Republican Party toward the far right.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271000407X","25-43","Theda Skocpol","Harvard University.

They advocate for members&#39; interests in the public arena, but also operate as Tocquevillian &#8220;schools of democracy&#8221; linking citizens to politics and equipping them with the skills of democratic citizenship. Yet scant research has examined the interrelationships of these two roles. Does the work that civic associations do in developing democratic participants enhance the work they do advocating for members&#39; interests in the public arena? We bring together two previously disparate strands of research on civic associations by arguing that a key factor affecting the political presence of civic associations is leadership quality. We focus on the relationship of leadership quality to political presence, using data from a unique 2003 study of 226 local entities of the Sierra Club. We show that organizations with more skilled and committed leaders have higher levels of political presence. This contrasts with previous research that has focused primarily on community context and resources as explanatory factors. This study shows that political presence is related to the extent to which leaders develop their skills and demonstrate commitment to the organization.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710004081","45-59","Kenneth T.

To the extent that special districts have received any scholarly attention, it has focused mostly on estimating how specialization affects the level of public spending.

In a period when headlines are dominated by economic recession, unemployment, and oil spills, the focus of Brian Mayer's book takes on practical urgency. The question is theoretically intriguing as well. Labor unions are often characterized as archetypical interest-based organizations, representing industrial workers' concerns for their own material well-being. Environmental mobilization, in contrast, is seen as a quality-of-life movement most commonly associated with members of the postindustrial middle class who possess leisure time and resources sufficient to enable their activism. When the question of how to regulate industries that employ toxic chemicals arises, these two groups can become locked in an acrimonious jobs versus the environment debate, making them more likely antagonists than allies. This sense of latent opposition is captured by one worker's assertion that greens want to &#8220;save the whales and kill the workers&#8221; (p. 2). How can these divisions be overcome? In his clearly written and compelling book, Blue&#8211;Green Coalitions, Mayer argues that concern over the effects of hazardous materials on human health offers one avenue for generating powerful and enduring coalitions.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication March 15 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710003403","109-110","Laura A.

Mirroring that debate within the environmental movement, in 2004 the Service Employees International Union called for major reforms within the AFL-CIO; demanding that the labor federation focus on organizing new workers rather than defending its existing members. This divide within the AFL-CIO ultimately led to the formation of the Change to Win coalition, with several other major unions joining the SEIU in a new reformist coalition federation.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication March 15 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710003415","111-111","Brian Mayer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","805","37"

Red to Green delivers an important contribution to the field of contemporary Russian politics by utilizing the environmental movement to illustrate the growth of civil society and the strategies used by civic organizations to overcome the institutional and normative barriers created by the legacy of Soviet rule. Given the deplorable state of the Russian Federation's environment, a strong environmental movement would seem a logical outcome of the internationally desired democratization and participation in civil society among the Russian citizenry. Yet as Henry is careful to point out, participation in social movement organizations is not always a natural consequence of environmental grievances, and in order for green groups to survive, they must make use of preexisting norms, institutions, and social networks that both enable and constrain their efforts to advocate for a safe and healthy environment.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication March 15 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710003427","111-113","Brian Mayer","University of Florida","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","662","64"

In doing so, he provides me the opportunity to highlight and expand upon these themes. Mayer's comments suggest that the study of social movements is enriched by the interaction of scholars focused on vastly different societies. In this vein, attention to one key aspect of my argument&#8212;how activists' diverse interpretations of the Soviet period shape their current perceptions&#8212;helps respond to some of the questions that Mayer raises.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication March 15 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710003439","113-113","Laura A.

By Thomas Princen","Treading Softly: Paths to Ecological Order. By Thomas Princen. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2010. 224p. $22.95.When you are trying to get someone to embrace new habits of mind and body, like, say, those of ecological sustainability, it sometimes works to appeal to common sense. Thomas Princen employs this stragegy of persuasion&#8212;he also invokes enlightened self-interest, but I think he prefers to appeal to common sense&#8212;in his bold, tolerant, honest, and powerful short book. To be more specific, he invokes a set of minor or currently rather quiet &#8220;segments&#8221; (p. 171) inside the mixed bag that is American common sense. Common sense is not, after all, a stable block but a conglomeration of diverse parts, some of which do not fit at all well with the others. And it is the heterogeneity of the common store of wisdom that makes possible Princen's reorganization of it. He highlights some underutilized segments of the &#8220;old normal&#8221; and harnesses their power to the project of building a society that &#8220;takes infinite material growth as impossible,&#8221; &#8220;embraces limits&#8221; (p. 187), and is devoted to &#8220;living well by living well within our means&#8221; (p. 124).<p class='Dates'>(Online publication March 15 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710003440","115-117","Jane Bennett","Johns Hopkins University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","710","149"

These practices combine authoritarian concentrations of power with deliberative influence, producing the apparent anomaly of authoritarian deliberation. Although deliberation is usually associated with democracy, they are distinct phenomena. Democracy involves the inclusion of individuals in matters that affect them through distributions of empowerments such as votes and rights. Deliberation is a mode of communication involving persuasion-based influence. Combinations of non-inclusive power and deliberative influence&#8212;authoritarian deliberation&#8212;are readily identifiable in China, probably reflecting failures of command authoritarianism under the conditions of complexity and pluralism produced by market-oriented development. The concept of authoritarian deliberation frames two possible trajectories of political development in China: the increasing use of deliberative practices stabilizes and strengthens authoritarian rule, or deliberative practices serve as a leading edge of democratization.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711000892","269-289","Baogang He","School of International and Political Studies, Deakin University, Australia, and Tianjin Normal University, China.

But they may provide a misleading framework for monitoring ongoing &#8220;self-equilibrating&#8221; social processes with no natural &#8220;end state&#8221; such as democratization. I propose that modern biology can be consulted as an alternative source of analogical reasoning, offering a more flexible and appropriate stock of metaphors that can enliven analogical accounts of processes of democratization. The shift towards modeling democracy as a living practice permanently directed towards self-preservation and propagation provides a clearer rationale for comparative studies, focussing on the relative &#8220;quality&#8221; of democracy in different contexts. I begin with a brief sketch of the historical instability and current contestability of most democratization processes; I then examine the morphology of complex political concepts and propose alternative biological analogies to replace the currently prevalent physicalist imagery.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711000909","291-299","Laurence Whitehead","Nuffield College, Oxford.

The impact of social media on contentious politics represents one of the many areas which will require significant new thinking. The dramatic change in the information environment over the last decade has changed individual competencies, the ability to organize for collective action, and the transmission of information from the local to the international level. It has also strengthened some of the core competencies of authoritarian states even as it has undermined others. The long term evolution of a new kind of public sphere may matter more than immediate political outcomes, however. Rigorous testing of competing hypotheses about the impact of the new social media will require not only conceptual development but also the use of new kinds of data analysis not traditionally adopted in Middle East area studies.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711000910","301-310","Marc Lynch","Institute for Middle East Studies, George Washington University.

Spatial diagrams raise questions and provide insights. They suggest political maneuvers, possible realignments, and political problems. They provide us with revealing images that aid memory and facilitate analysis.

Law and courts are distinct and yet connected to political processes and policy outcomes in complex and nuanced ways. The question for law and courts scholars, then, is how and why do political actors (with seemingly increasing frequency) turn to law and the judiciary to influence public policy, and what are the impacts of infusing law and courts into the US political process?

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009. 212p. $80.00 cloth, $22.99 paper.Alexis de Tocqueville is surely one of the most widely cited, discussed, and celebrated political theorists in the world. Jon Elster's book, Alexis de Tocqueville: the First Social Scientist proceeds from a provocative premise: that Tocqueville's major works were lacking in &#8220;system&#8221; and were &#8220;hugely incoherent,&#8221; and that Tocqeuville himself &#8220;was not a major political thinker&#8221; (xi). Elster argues that instead Tocqueville ought to be viewed as a penetrating historical sociologist and an exemplary social scientist who might well be considered the first true social scientist. Elster's argument is important for at least two reasons: first, because it offers a striking and challenging reading of Tocqueville; and second, because it expands on Elster's own contributions in the philosophy of social science, and develops interesting understandings of &#8220;causal mechanisms,&#8221; methodological individualism, and social explanation more generally. As Elster writes in his Introduction, &#8220;the main task of this book is to argue for the relevance of Tocqueville for social science in the twenty-first century (p. 5).&#8221; The purpose of this Perspectives symposium is to assess Elster's argument in broad terms.

How ought we to assess Elster's understanding of Tocqueville's deficiencies as a &#8220;political theorist?&#8221; What is the relevance of Tocqueville for contemporary social science?

The first is that by limiting our study to the post&#8211;Cold War period, we convert it into a &#8220;period piece,&#8221; akin to studies of fascist and communist regimes. Although this may be true, a historically bounded analysis is essential because of the changing character of the international environment. World historical time powerfully shapes regime outcomes. The prospects for democracy and authoritarianism during the Cold War, which was marked by global superpower rivalry, differed dramatically from those during periods of Western liberal hegemony. During the Cold War, for example, nearly all military coups ushered in authoritarian rule; after 1989, nearly 70 percent of coups led to multiparty elections In 1989, single-party rule predominated in Eastern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa; five years later, it had disappeared.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication June 03 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711000454","388-389","Steven Levitsky","","Lucan A.

While Alonso and his coauthors call for an infusion of resources into urban schools, I remain skeptical both that underfunding really is the source of their problems and that more money would be used effectively absent more fundamental reforms. But when an urban school district truly lacks sufficient resources to provide a safe and humane learning environment, then certainly more funding is called for.

The story of ACT UP, the central focus of the work, illuminates the complex history of both the AIDS epidemic and the political dynamics of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities at a key moment of transition. Founded during the conservative backlash of the Reagan era and active through the conservative turn in LGBT politics of the early Clinton years (with the prioritization of questions like military service), the group's confrontational tactics, radical discourse, and political successes prove something of an anomaly. Explaining this anomaly is Gould's central concern, and in doing so, she offers a compelling argument for the importance of addressing affect and emotion in the study of social movements, providing a carefully nuanced conceptual framework to do so.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication June 03 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711000508","397-398","Rafael de la Dehesa","City University of New York","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","542","95"

Let me begin with Rafael de la Dehesa's suggestion that I may have overstated my challenge to the political opportunity model of social movement emergence. In arguing for the importance of bringing emotion into our analyses, I state that the task is not to consider feelings in isolation but rather as they articulate with more frequently studied factors that shape activism and movements, including political opportunities. Because feelings always play out in contexts, attention to them necessitates attention to the larger contexts in and through which they emerge and operate. In my view, one of the crucial insights that scholars in the political opportunity tradition make is that the larger political environment is a critical factor in movement emergence; we disagree, I believe, in our understandings of how that external context matters. The model's emphasis on the necessity of opening political opportunities for movement emergence, conveyed in its proponents' programmatic statements and suggested by the model's very name, precludes instances when movements arise in the face of tightly constricting opportunities, as occurred in the case of the AIDS movement. Even if, as de la Dehesa suggests, we were to understand ACT UP's emergence as an example of an existing movement shifting to more confrontational tactics in the face of institutional intransigence, the political opportunity model still comes up short: when the AIDS movement emerged in the early 1980s, AIDS and lesbian and gay activists faced tightly constricted opportunities. In light of the model's limitations, and after sorting through mountains of empirical material that revealed a dramatic shift in the prevailing emotional habitus in lesbian and gay communities during the period of ACT UP's emergence, it seemed like a focus on emotion would help illuminate how the external political environment affects movement processes.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication June 03 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271100051X","399-399","Deborah B.

The two cases are ideal for comparative analysis: Movements in both countries emerged under semiauthoritarian regimes and operated as their countries transitioned to democracy, but the paths they took show striking differences, allowing de la Dehesa to argue forcefully for the importance of the local and the contingent as activists navigate the national and transnational fields in which they are embedded. As the concept of embeddedness warrants, even while pointing toward the importance of the particular and the agentic, de la Dehesa carefully shows as well how constrained, and enabled, activists were by the multiple fields in which they operated. Queering the Public Sphere in Mexico and Brazil, then, successfully charts an analytical course that recognizes the powerful but nontotalizing nature of institutions, economic forces, and discourses.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication June 03 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711000521","399-401","Deborah B.

I thought all Greeks were Orthodox?&#8221; As a Jewish-American growing up in New York City, whose paternal grandparents were Jews who had emigrated from Greece in the 1920s, I was frequently asked this question by well-meaning&#8212;if confused&#8212;friends and acquaintances. Indeed, while &#8220;Greek Jew&#8221; has always been a central aspect of my multiply-hyphenated American identity, in fact my grandfather Morris Isaac, n&#233; Izaki, was from Salonika and, it turns out, he himself grew up as a Turkish Jew under the Ottoman Empire, only to discover after World War I that he was in fact (now) not a Turkish but a Greek Jew (which was not, in the parlance of his time, synonymous with being an authentic &#8220;Greek&#8221;). Greek (Orthodox) or Jewish? Greek or Turkish? Pogroms, wars, &#8220;ethnic cleansings,&#8221; and sometimes even genocides have been undertaken to resolve such questions, and indeed my ancestors experienced all of these things in the opening decades of the twentieth century. For my family, such traumas are part of the story of how my grandparents came to leave Greece and migrate to the US and become Americans and US citizens (alas, many of their relatives were not able to leave, and most ultimately perished at the hands of the Nazis).<p class='Dates'>(Online publication September 20 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271100288X","501-503","Jeffrey C.

These are less present in the US because of a distinct history, institutional separation of powers, and an ideological populism based in opposition to public sector expansion. Despite these constraints the American state is a powerful actor in US politics and has been since the nineteenth century engaged in familiar revenue raising, regulatory, public order, coercive, military, and distributive functions. To understand these we propose a framework based on how the endogenous drive to standardize shapes these functions and gives a distinct character to the American state. We identify impulses to standardize, instruments of standardization, and enduring obstacles to this agenda.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711002726","505-518","Marc Stears","University College, Oxford and the Institute for Public Policy Research.

Conservatives are viewed as the chief proponents of marketizing reforms featuring retrenchment of social programs, privatization of social services, deregulation, and tax reduction, as well as of disciplining policies that impose more stringent behavioral requirements on beneficiaries, employ testing and reporting to monitor recipient performance, and impose sanctions for non-compliance.

The U.S. has coercively constituted the identities of many persons of Mexican descent, inside and outside its boundaries, in ways that have fostered aspirations for dual economic, cultural, and political &#8220;citizenships.&#8221; It has also shaped the identities, values, and interests of many whites in immigrant-receiving states in ways that make Mexican immigrants seem threatening, even as it has made those states pay most of the costs of absorbing immigrants. In consequence, the U.S. should adopt policies that give priority to Mexicans in immigration and that facilitate dual citizenships, while providing more aid to immigrant-receiving states.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271100274X","545-557","Rogers M.

In his essay, Rogers Smith attempts to describe a just immigration policy, one that could ease anti-immigrant conflict, based on obligations upon the U.S. government that arise from its coercive shaping of the social identities and aspirations of Mexican immigrants. Smith is correct to focus on the conflicts between intersecting and contradictory factors that affect identity formation among immigrants, but I argue that a focus on similar conflicts among those who hold strong anti-immigrant views suggests that such contradictions may also be animating anti-Mexican immigrant hostility. Among the most important of these may be those arising from the American dream&#8212;a formative narrative that encourages euphoria about socioeconomic possibilities but that cloaks underlying economic instabilities, exploitation, and widespread vulnerabilities. The pain of these contradictions, typically unacknowledged by those whom they affect, can spike in times of economic downturn, exciting anti-Mexican immigrant sentiments that provide an outlet for the rage and agony of unresolved conflict.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711002751","559-562","Edwina Barvosa","Departments of Chicana and Chicano Studies and Feminist Studies, University of California at Santa Barbara.

Over the last hundred years, many rural communities in Mexico have been constituted more by U.S. immigration policy and the labor demands of U.S. employers than by similar policies and economic factors in Mexico. According to Smith, this means that Mexicans may be owed &#8220;special access&#8221; to American residency and citizenship, ahead of the residents of countries less affected by U.S. policies, and in ways that should justify leniency toward undocumented Mexican immigrants.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711002763","563-565","Rafael Alarc&#243;n","University of Valencia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1075","364"

Mexican Immigration and American Obligations&#8221; is whether the tortured history of U.S.-Mexican relations and the racialized context of Mexican immigrant reception can best be ameliorated through targeted immigration policies that would create added opportunities for Mexican migrants relative to others. I argue that the current, more universally-principled system of U.S. immigration policy, supplemented by an inclusive legalization program, can better serve the needs of potential Mexican migrants and Mexican immigrants resident in the United States.

I identify the principle of jus temporis, a law of measured calendrical time, that has worked in concert with jus soli and consent to construct citizenship law since the nation&#39;s founding. Jus temporis translates measured durations of time such as &#8220;time in residence&#8221; or &#8220;time worked&#8221; into entitlement to rights and status. It creates temporal algorithms in which measured calendrical time plus additional variables (e.g., physical presence, education, or behavior) equals consent to citizenship. I explore recent scholarly references to temporal principles and trace the history of how jus temporis was invoked by the nation&#39;s first Supreme Court jurisprudence on citizenship and the first Congressional debates about immigration and naturalization. Scholarly convergence on the principle of jus temporis as well as its originalist pedigree imbue this principle with the potential to resolve contemporary disagreements about the rights and status of foreign-born persons in the US.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711002787","575-583","Elizabeth F.

The Discouraging Politics of American Education (and What We Might Do about It)","Ever since 1954, when a unanimous Supreme Court declared that education is &#8220;a right that must be made available to all on equal terms,&#8221; Americans have been debating the meaning of educational equality, how it might be attained, and through what instrumentalities of government. Brown v. Board of Education was arguably the most important Supreme Court decision of the twentieth century, not only because it ended legal segregation in schools but also for incorporating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as a tool to promote racial equality in other aspects of American life. Brown also thrust the federal courts deeply into primary and secondary education and opened the door to further federal intervention in a sphere of government that historically belonged to the states and localities. Debates over federalism, separation of powers, policy alternatives, and the role of government in promoting educational and social equality remain very much alive today as the Obama administration puts forth its education agenda, states struggle with its demands, and Congress reconsiders the contours of No Child Left Behind (NCLB).<p class='Dates'>(Online publication September 20 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711002799","585-596","Joseph P.

Needless to say, this is as true of criminal activities as any other sphere of human endeavor, especially when it comes to trafficking drugs. According to the United Nations, as of 2010 the trade in opiates generates an annual turnover of up to $65 billion, with cocaine accounting for a further $88 billion. The crudest street gang peddling crack or heroin in a darkened stairwell is part of a complex transnational business, even if its members scarcely know from which country their product originally hails. The roaring torrents of Afghan opiates and Latin American cocaine crash through border checkpoints, leaving corrupted customs officers and pipelines for other illicit transfers in their wake, hollow out political systems, and transform into equally powerful flows of dirty money that in due course wash into every banking system in the world.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication September 20 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711002416","597-601","Mark Galeotti","Center for Global Affairs, New York University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1251","386"

Nevertheless, despite considerable efforts such programs have generally failed in terms of advancing the economic status of majorities. In this article I will suggest that EBRs in post-colonial states are not solely intended to ameliorate economic gaps, but rather are also a policy tool used by governing elites to advance a narrative of state ownership, and by extension a decidedly non-liberal notion of democratic citizenship. I explore this claim through an analysis of Malaysia and Fiji, two post-colonial states characterized by persistent asymmetric claims by ethnic majorities who claim legitimacy by virtue of indigenousness. The discussion will focus first on the formation, deployment, and persistence of claims of ethnic hierarchy by professedly indigenous groups. Second, attention will be paid to how such claims are linked to demands for ethnically based redistribution following a direct challenge to extant ethnic hierarchies. Finally, the policies will be assessed both in terms of their stated economic objectives and in terms of their ability to generate a broader sense of autochthonous identity.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271100394X","785-802","Brian D.

We describe and defend a realist theory of foreign policy to guide American decision makers. Briefly, the theory says that if they want to ensure their security, great powers such as the United States should balance against other great powers. They should also take a relaxed view toward developments involving minor powers and, at most, should balance against hostile minor powers that inhabit strategically important regions of the world. We then show that had the great powers followed our theory&#39;s prescriptions, some of the most important wars of the past century might have been averted. Specifically, the world wars might not have occurred, and the United States might not have gone to war in either Vietnam or Iraq. In other words, realism as we conceive it offers the prospect of security without war. At the same time, we also argue that if the United States adopts an alternative liberal foreign policy, this is likely to result in more, rather than fewer, wars. We conclude by offering some theoretically-based proposals about how US decision makers should deal with China and Iran.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711003963","803-819","Sebastian Rosato","University of Notre Dame.

However, I argue that by focusing on what I term social movement-borne nonprofits, we can see how these organizations may engage (marginalized) communities and participate in political activities. To illustrate, I consider the California Prostitutes Education Project (CAL-PEP) and the St. James Infirmary (SJI), two San Francisco Bay-area nonprofits created by prostitute-rights activists that offer HIV/AIDS and other health services to sex workers. Drawing on multi-method qualitative research on CAL-PEP and the SJI, I argue that social movement-borne nonprofits engage in political activities through a process of radical institutionalization, whereby they incorporate and advance activist goals within their organizational practices. I theorize the properties of radical institutionalization as &#8220;oppositional implementation,&#8221; &#8220;community engagement,&#8221; and &#8220;claims-making activities.&#8221; My hope is that scholars will test for and further define these properties in order to broaden understandings of nonprofits&#39; evolving role in civic and political life, and in processes of social change.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711003951","821-839","Samantha Majic","John Jay College/City University of New York.

Indeed, the invitation arrived at a propitious time because, after completing our most recent book, we critically reflected on the fact that we had unfortunately written almost nothing on the oldest, and one of the most diverse, democracies in the world, the United States.

By Liesl Haas","The election of Michelle Bachelet as president of Chile in January 2006 was heralded in the world press as an advancement of women's rights in Chile. Not only did Bachelet's election increase women's representation at the highest levels, but it also raised expectations that Chile would adopt more women-friendly policies as well. Although focused on the years between the democratic transition and the election of Bachelet, Liesl Haas's Feminist Policymaking in Chile speaks volumes to the questions of how and why such representation makes a difference. Although the women's movement and feminist policymaking in Chile have been well mined by gender scholars, Haas provides a different perspective, both in terms of time frame and of theoretical argument. The book is notable for its extensive documentation of the legislative process, church activism, and feminist policymaking in Chile in the posttransition era. This rich description will make it valuable to gender scholars wishing to understand the Chilean case and to Latin Americanists wishing to understand more about gender politics in Chile.

By Lee Ann Banaszak","In this impressively researched and thought-provoking book, Lee Ann Banaszak explores the role of &#8220;movement insiders&#8221;&#8212;women's movement activists working inside the federal bureaucracy&#8212;in shaping policy on women's rights. Through a series of engaging narratives, she highlights the often-invisible role of feminist lawyers, regulators, other members of the civil service, and political appointees in shaping important policies on such issues as equal employment, educational equity (particularly Title IX), and foreign policy (women in development). Banaszak's investigation into the role of feminist activists within the bureaucracy illuminates the critical role that the movement played within the state on a number of policy issues. More broadly, her argument for an expanded view of the dynamics of social movements, movement&#8211;state intersections, and policymaking represents a needed corrective to the rather stark dichotomies that often dominate the study of social movements.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication December 08 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711003793","885-887","Liesl Haas","California State University, Long Beach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","741","96"

She raises two set of questions which I would like to address here. First, she asks whether a better sample of insider activists would have been found by choosing key pieces of policy and identifying the major players as she does in her own book. While every sampling strategy represents a trade-off when no clear sampling frame exists, such a method seems to me fraught with a number of dangers, including a selection bias towards visible and successful cases (which might lead us to examine only insider feminist successes and exclude those who were influential but less visible) and predefinition by the investigator of what constitutes a feminist policy. I believe one of the strengths of my study was the finding that insider feminists influenced policies ordinarily not identified as feminist&#8212;such as foreign aid legislation or scientific research in the NIH. Haas argues a change in sampling method might have increased the number of younger feminists (who were underrepresented in the sample) but their underrepresentation results largely from a focus on activists in higher positions in the bureaucracy, the tendency of fewer feminists to enter the bureaucracy under post-Reagan republican administrations, and my conscious decision to focus on the period before 2001 when interviewing so that I did not ask questions about the current administration.<p class='Dates'>(Online publication December 08 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711003999","887-887","Lee Ann Banaszak","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","672","34"

In other words, should we view endemic political violence in ostensibly democratic states to be deviations from appropriate democratic behavior (i.e., a bug or flaw in a given system), or is it the case that the violence in question should be understood as an inherent part of the system, perhaps even if it is still to be considered a democracy (i.e., a feature or constituent element thereof)?<p class='Dates'>(Online publication December 08 2011)","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592711003902","891-892","Steven L.

Zine El Abidine Ben Ali had ruled Tunisia for 20 years, and Hosni Mubarak reigned in Egypt for 30 years. Yet their bravest challengers were 20- and 30-year-olds without ideological baggage, violent intentions, or clear leaders. Political change in these countries inspired activists across the region. Some tough authoritarian governments responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, others with policy concessions, welfare spending, and cabinet shuffles. The groups that initiated and sustained protests had few meaningful experiences with public deliberation or voting, and little experience with successful protesting. These young citizens were politically disciplined, pragmatic, and collaborative. Where did they come from? How do young people growing up in modern, entrenched, authoritarian regimes find political inspirations and aspirations?

The most obvious change is the journal's cover design which, in bringing Perspectives in line with its two APSA sister publications, is intended to make the journal more inviting (and while you can't judge a journal by its cover, it's surely a good thing for a journal cover to look good and invite readers to discover what is inside). A second set of changes affect the journal's editorial philosophy and policy. When I assumed the journal's editorship last June I promised that I would soon share a general statement of my editorial vision. This statement immediately follows the Introduction you are now reading (it is also posted online on our website). As you will see when you read it, my editorial team and I intend to build upon the previous achievements of Perspectives at the same time that we attempt some exciting changes.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992623","1-5","Jeffrey C.

This article addresses how these organizations fostered collective consciousness among women, a large and diverse group, while confronting the echoes of backlash against previous mobilization efforts by women. We argue that the March and Code Pink achieved mobilization success by creating hybrid organizations that blended elements of three major collective action frames: maternalism, egalitarianism, and feminine expression. These innovative organizations invented hybrid forms that cut across movements, constituencies, and political institutions. Using surveys, interviews, and content analysis of organizational documents, this article explains how the March and Code Pink met the contemporary challenges facing women&#39;s collective action in similar yet distinct ways. It highlights the role of feminine expression and concerns about the intersectional marginalization of women in resolving the historic tensions between maternalism and egalitarianism. It demonstrates hybridity as a useful analytical lens to understand gendered organizing and other forms of grassroots collective action.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992659","27-52","Kristin A.

Since then their membership patterns have diverged as the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) continues to decline and the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) has reached near record numbers. These patterns raise two questions: Why the decline? And why the divergence? On the cause of decline, I argue that a younger civil rights generation, informed by a new set of post-materialist values, did not join traditional organizations like the BSA and GSUSA because their values were deemed to be outdated. The challenge for traditional organizations therefore was how to respond. Using path dependency theory, I argue that BSA and GSUSA&#8212;shaped by their own unique origins and identities&#8212;responded very differently to the critical juncture of the civil rights generation, which in turn explains the subsequent divergence in membership patterns from the 1980s onward. While the BSA rejects such changes in order to defend traditional values, the GSUSA, which established a commitment to challenging gender norms from its birth, embraces the new values and adapts virtually every aspect of its organizational identity to this new generation. As young people see themselves reflected back in the values endorsed by the GSUSA, its membership resurges, while the BSA continues to decline. I conclude by drawing out larger theoretical lessons on the meaning of change in American civil society in light of an increasingly diverse population.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992660","53-68","Barbara Arneil","University of British Columbia.

An enduring puzzle is, therefore, why the US lags so far behind other countries when it comes to women&#39;s political representation. In 2008, women held only 16.8 percent of seats in the House of Representatives, a proportion that ranks America lower than 83 other countries. This article addresses this conundrum. It establishes that equal rights alone are insufficient to ensure equal access to political office. Also necessary are public policies representing maternal traits that voters associate with women. Such policies have feedback effects that teach voters that the maternal traits attributed to women represent strengths not only in the private sphere of the home but also in the public sphere of the state. Most other democracies now have such policies in place, but the United States lacks such policies, which accounts for its laggard status with regard to the political representation of women.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992672","69-91","Eileen McDonagh","Northeastern University.

A Gendered Analysis of Varieties of Political Knowledge","While studies typically find that women know less about politics than do men, feminist scholars have argued that these findings reflect gender-biased measures that underestimate women&#39;s political knowledge. This article evaluates the feminist critique by taking a more expansive view of what constitutes political knowledge. Using data from a large Canadian urban sample, we show that gender gaps close or even reverse when people are queried about more practical aspects of political knowledge, such as government benefits and services. Our results also demonstrate that this type of knowledge is more equally distributed than its conventional counterpart, though the women who are the most likely to need government services and benefits are often the least likely to know about them. Finally, we show that knowledge of government services and benefits has a significant effect on women&#39;s intended vote choice.

Notwithstanding the philosophical discussion of the constitutionally assigned role of courts in the political system and the idea of judicial independence, President Bush&#39;s statement raises an interesting empirical question: In the case of same-sex marriage, have state and federal courts really acted in direct opposition to the expressed policy preferences of current or recent legislative majorities or overturned popular initiatives and constitutional amendments? Using evidence from state and federal legislative and judicial action around same-sex marriage primarily from the fifteen years preceding President Bush&#39;s 2006 statement, I argue that, with some rare exceptions, judges can not easily be identified as &#8220;activist&#8221; on the issue of same-sex marriage even if we assess their actions according to President Bush&#39;s criteria.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992696","111-126","Scott Barclay","University at Albany: SUNY.

In the face of a quagmire, presidents might choose among three broad strategic options&#8212;disengagement, escalation, or continuity. I argue that the first alternative, to withdraw, is made impossible by the inflated rhetoric presidents invoke to sell a skeptical public on the necessity for a limited war and by their own conviction (reinforced by core supporters) that the price of defeat is too great. At the opposite pole lies the possibility of full-scale mobilization. But because presidents during the Vietnam and Iraq wars believed they could also pursue expensive domestic agendas, they did not reserve the resources needed for large-scale escalation. In the both cases, too, civilian leaders were deeply skeptical about their military counterparts and discounted their caution that a greater military commitment would be needed. Finally, as wars drag on, public disenchantment prevents presidents from mustering the political support escalation would require. Their early decisions thus leave them with no alternative to their current strategic commitment.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992702","127-139","Andrew J.

Blog Readership, Participation, and Polarization in American Politics","Political scientists and political theorists debate the relationship between participation and deliberation among citizens with different political viewpoints. Blogs provide an important testing ground for their claims. We examine deliberation, polarization, and political participation among blog readers. We find that blog readers gravitate toward blogs that accord with their political beliefs. Few read blogs on both the left and right of the ideological spectrum. Furthermore, those who read left-wing blogs and those who read right-wing blogs are ideologically far apart. Blog readers are more polarized than either non-blog-readers or consumers of various television news programs, and roughly as polarized as US senators. Blog readers also participate more in politics than non-blog readers. Readers of blogs of different ideological dispositions do not participate less than those who read only blogs of one ideological disposition. Instead, readers of both left- and right-wing blogs and readers of exclusively leftwing blogs participate at similar levels, and both participate more than readers of exclusively right-wing blogs. This may reflect social movement-building efforts by left-wing bloggers.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992714","141-157","Eric Lawrence","Department of Political Science, George Washington University.

We show that policies promoting gender equality seek fundamental social change and therefore challenge historical patterns of state-society interaction concerning relations between the state and the market; the respective authority of the state, religion, and cultural groups; and the contours of citizenship. Different issues, however, challenge different aspects of these relations.

Specifically, the adoption and expansion of national policies on issues such as equal wages, childcare provision, paid maternity leave, and violence against women carry important messages to the electorate: Issues that disproportionately affect women, long considered private, have become important national policy choices.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992799","217-222","Miki Caul Kittilson","Arizona State University.

It argues that a CPG should analyze how major political processes and institutions are gendered thereby increasing our understanding of the major themes of comparative politics and enhancing the subfield. But a CPG should also go beyond this. It should be problem driven and should seek to answer some &#8220;big questions&#8221; that are important for any efforts to achieve gender equality such as how political change that lessens gender inequality occurs; and how positive gender outcomes come about in a range of contexts. A CPG therefore has an integral connection to a feminist project.

I then consider how scholars&#8212;both feminist and non-feminist&#8212;might generate new insights on political representation by expanding what is thought of as a &#8220;case&#8221; and what is meant by the term &#8220;gender.&#8221; I recommend increasing the scope of comparison by (1) opening up the definition of a case to include a broader range of units and events and (2) connecting the study of a single unit to patterns generated by the study of other similar units. I suggest moving away from equating women with gender by exploring (1) relations between women and men and (2) the impact of masculinities and femininities on the conduct of political life.

Solidarity and Choice in the American Feminist Movement","This symposium examines an emergent orientation within the American feminist movement called &#8220;choice feminism.&#8221; Choice feminists are primarily concerned with increasing the number of choices open to women and with decreasing judgments about the choices that individual women make. Choice feminists are best known for their argument that a woman who leaves the remunerated labor market to care for her children is a feminist in good standing; she makes a feminist decision. While media coverage of choice feminism has been extensive, political scientists have been comparatively quiet. In this symposium, four political scientists analyze and evaluate choice feminism, revealing their disagreement about the validity of the choice feminist position and about the meaning of choice feminism for movement politics, political judgment, and liberal political theory.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992829","241-245","Jennet Kirkpatrick","University of Michigan.

It arises in response to three common criticisms of feminism: that feminism is too radical, too exclusionary, and too judgmental. In response, choice feminism offers a worldview that does not challenge the status quo, that promises to include all women regardless of their choices, and that abstains from judgment altogether. Moreover, it enables feminists to sidestep the difficulties of making the personal political: making judgments and demanding change of friends, family, and lovers. Yet judgment, exclusion, and calls for change are unavoidable parts of politics. If feminists are not to withdraw from political life altogether, we have to acknowledge the difficulty of engaging in politics. Political claims are partial; we will inevitably exclude, offend, or alienate some of those whom we should wish to have as allies. The political concerns and dilemmas to which choice feminism responds are very real. However, we can take seriously the political motivations behind choice feminism without withdrawing from politics. Instead, we need to complement an acknowledgment of the political dilemmas facing feminists with a celebration of the pleasures of engaging in politics with those who differ from and disagree with us.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992830","247-253","Michaele L.

This article argues that the conflict between the quest for gender equality and the desire for sexual pleasure has long been a challenge for feminism. In fact, the second-wave of the American feminist movement split over issues related to sexuality. Feminists found themselves on opposite sides of a series of contentious debates about issues such as pornography, sex work, and heterosexuality, with one side seeing evidence of gender oppression and the other opportunities for sexual pleasure and empowerment. Since the mid-1990s, however, a third wave of feminism has developed that seeks to reunite the ideals of gender equality and sexual freedom. Inclusive, pluralistic, and non-judgmental, third-wave feminism respects the right of women to decide for themselves how to negotiate the often contradictory desires for both gender equality and sexual pleasure. While this approach is sometimes caricatured as uncritically endorsing whatever a woman chooses to do as feminist, this essay argues that third-wave feminism actually exhibits not a thoughtless endorsement of &#8220;choice,&#8221; but rather a deep respect for pluralism and self-determination.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992842","255-261","R.

Yet for feminism to retain its political vision as a quest for social justice, we must continue difficult conversations concerning how acting on our individual desires impacts the lives of others. In this essay, I argue that feminists can acknowledge women&#39;s diverse desires while forging a meaningful feminist community. I make this argument by considering feminism&#39;s relationship to time, and particularly how women&#39;s diverse desires are read in each moment in time. If we abandon the generational model, wherein each new generation of feminists improves upon the last, for a genealogical perspective where women recognize our feminist origins and empathize with the diverse struggles of other women, we might reaffirm social justice for the community as central to feminist politics. To articulate this possibility, I turn to the work of Simone de Beauvoir to explain her discovery of how her embodiment as a woman and her relationship to femininity becomes a way of grounding a feminist politics. Recognizing the &#8220;demands of femininity&#8221; in other women&#39;s lives allows us to affirm feminist community while retaining the capacity to make judgments that realize social justice as a feminist goal.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992854","263-269","Lori J.

Peripheral Visions has several high points, including a critique of secular theories that separate national imaginaries from Islamic practices of piety; a wonderful exploration of &#8220;qat chews&#8221;&#8212;a custom through which democratic dispositions and a national imaginary are promoted through semipublic discourses; an account of how the weakness of the state can enlarge the imagination of the nation; and an engagement with the effects of global neoliberalism on discursive practices in Yemen. Each level and mode is interwoven with the others.

Connolly's review of Peripheral Visions is what any author should want, a thoughtful, appreciative account of the book's merits and an invitation to push aspects of the argument further than the book currently does. One point of clarification: I did not mean to suggest that Foucault's work should be read only in terms of its emphasis on coherence and control, or that my own is intended as a blanket critique of his. My understanding of political power and resistance is beholden to Foucault's insofar as he shows how power depends on multiple points of resistance. He thus describes how existing mechanisms of social control get reproduced and yet are also vulnerable to creativity, innovation, and surprise. My point was to challenge Foucault-inspired scholars of colonialism, in particular, who tend to exaggerate the capacities of colonial administrations and to neglect not only outright challenges to colonial rule, but also the ways in which colonial rule could, at times, be irrelevant to inhabitants' political experience. The goal was to distinguish between the stated claims of colonial rulers and colonialism's actual effects. At stake is not simply a reading of Foucault, of course, but a sense of what matters politically&#8212;whether scholars emphasize the reproductive power of institutions and ideas or whether they focus on how reproduction places those very ideas and institutions at risk. I want to chart a middle course here, neither exaggerating coherence nor romanticizing resistance.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270999260X","298-300","Lisa Wedeen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","755","222"

The core argument is as follows. Countries making the shift from war to peace face a multipronged transition in the economic, legal, political, social, and security sectors. Given this multifaceted transition, economic reconstruction is fundamentally different from the &#8220;development as usual&#8221; approach taken by the international community to address typical socioeconomic challenges faced by peaceful developing countries. Instead, economic reconstruction in postconflict countries is a &#8220;development plus&#8221; challenge, meaning that these countries face the same challenges as other developing countries plus the added challenge of achieving reconciliation and peace. Del Castillo concludes that many post&#8211;Cold War reconstruction efforts have failed because of the development as usual approach to reconstruction, a lack of comprehensive planning, insufficient aid and assistance, and the inadequacies of international organizations (e.g., the United Nations and international financial institutions) in dealing with the challenges of reconstruction.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270999288X","302-304","Christopher J.

I will focus my response on what del Castillo finds to be the major shortcoming of my book&#8212;the main policy implication. In After War, I conclude that current approaches to reconstruction, which typically rely on military occupation, are more likely to fail than to succeed. This outcome is not due to a lack of planning, effort, or political will, but is instead is the result of the array of incentives and constraints limiting what occupiers and policymakers can rationally design and implement in foreign societies. In considering alternative strategies for exporting the ideas, values, and beliefs underpinning liberal democracy, I argue that the U.S. should assume a default position of military non-intervention and free trade (unilateral if necessary). Del Castillo is sympathetic to this position as a &#8220;preventive measure,&#8221; but does not seem convinced of its suitability as a primary strategy. For example, she points out that offering trade preferences to the Taliban following 9/11 would hardly have brought liberalism to Afghanistan. I agree. However, I do not think this point undercuts my argument for a default position of free trade and non-intervention. Let me clarify why I believe this to be the case.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709992453","306-307","Christopher J. Coyne","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","543","74"

The journal was conceived as a medium of broad scholarly communication and publication. And we have recently been very deliberate in promoting the idea that Perspectives is a &#8220;political science public sphere.&#8221; At the heart of our editorial policies and our review process is the central question we ask of all authors: how does your piece speak to the broad readership of political scientists who are our primary audience?","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271000126X","407-410","Jeffrey C.

Analytic eclecticism is not an alternative model of research or a means to displace or subsume existing modes of scholarship. It is an intellectual stance that supports efforts to complement, engage, and selectively utilize theoretical constructs embedded in contending research traditions to build complex arguments that bear on substantive problems of interest to both scholars and practitioners. Eclectic scholarship is marked by three general features. First, it is consistent with an ethos of pragmatism in seeking engagement with the world of policy and practice, downplaying unresolvable metaphysical divides and presumptions of incommensurability and encouraging a conception of inquiry marked by practical engagement, inclusive dialogue, and a spirit of fallibilism. Second, it formulates problems that are wider in scope than the more narrowly delimited problems posed by adherents of research traditions; as such, eclectic inquiry takes on problems that more closely approximate the messiness and complexity of concrete dilemmas facing &#8220;real world&#8221; actors. Third, in exploring these problems, eclectic approaches offer complex causal stories that extricate, translate, and selectively recombine analytic components&#8212;most notably, causal mechanisms&#8212;from explanatory theories, models, and narratives embedded in competing research traditions.

In this essay I argue that this trend has been hastened by the inappropriate incorporation of paradigm mentalities, first presented by Thomas Kuhn and later developed by Imre Lakatos. I show how paradigm mentalities help justify rigid opposition to theoretical alternatives and limit critical insight. While paradigm mentalities may be fitting for disciplines that demonstrate Kuhn&#39;s concrete scientific achievements, they constrain the study of political science and international relations in particular. I begin with a primer that compares Kuhn and Lakatos to Karl Popper. Next, I point to harmful consequences resulting from applying paradigm mentalities to the study of international relations. Among these is the tendency to act as if realism has earned the status of a paradigm and then invoke criteria of incommensurability and &#8220;subsumption&#8221; to deflect criticism. I conclude by discussing how Popper&#39;s model of science provides a better platform for the study of politics by encouraging theoretical and methodological pluralism.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710001180","433-451","Thomas C.

However, the more worrisome development is scholasticism&#8212;a tendency for research to become overspecialized and ingrown. I define that trend more closely and document its growth through increases in numbers of journals, organized sections in the American Political Science Association, and divisions within the APSA conference. I also code articles published in the American Political Science Review to show a growth in scholastic features in recent decades. The changes affect all fields in political science. Scholasticism serves values of rigor. To restrain it will require reemphasizing relevance to real-world issues and audiences. To do this should also help restore morale among political scientists.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710001192","453-464","Lawrence M.

I argue that social scientific political theory is political science and its many strains&#8212;conceptual, normative, and explanatory&#8212;belong in the discipline on their own terms. Humanistic research, like dermatology or music theory, is not political science and as such it should find another home.

Participatory Inequality and the Internet","What is the impact of the possibility of political participation on the Internet on long-standing patterns of participatory inequality in American politics? An August 2008 representative survey of Americans conducted by the Pew Internet and American Life Project provides little evidence that there has been any change in the extent to which political participation is stratified by socio-economic status, but it suggests that the web has ameliorated the well-known participatory deficit among those who have just joined the electorate. Even when only that subset of the population with Internet access is considered, participatory acts such as contributing to candidates, contacting officials, signing a political petition, or communicating with political groups are as stratified socio-economically when done on the web as when done offline. The story is different for stratification by age where historically younger people have been less engaged than older people in most forms of political participation. Young adults are much more likely than their elders to be comfortable with electronic technologies and to use the Internet, but among Internet users, the young are not especially politically active. How these trends play out in the future depends on what happens to the current Web-savvy younger generation and the cohorts that follow and on the rapidly developing political capacities of the Web.

I discuss field experiments as a promising method for evaluating the effects of democracy assistance programs. Applied to the 2004 presidential elections in Indonesia, the random assignment of international election observers reveals that even though the election was widely regarded as democratic, the presence of observers had a measurable effect on votes cast for the incumbent candidate, indicating that such democracy assistance can influence election quality even in the absence of blatant election-day fraud.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710001222","511-527","Susan D.

Moore&#39;s core themes were revolutionary classes, revolutionary violence, and the outcomes of revolution. As the 1960s and the 1970s gave way to the 1980s and 1990s, Tilly faced a different world-historical situation. So-called national liberation moments&#8212;violent and radical, communist and anti-U.S.&#8212;did not always win. And when they did succeed, radical politics was not particularly appealing. Tilly&#39;s final challenge involved rational-choice theory&#39;s drive for hegemony in explaining all outcomes&#8212;political, economic, and social&#8212;of macrohistorical change. For example, could a systematic alternative to the major approach to contention and conflict&#8212;a bargaining theory of war&#8212;be developed? To address these changing problem situations, Tilly fashioned his own unique theories, methods, and domains of inquiry. A truly seminal thinker, he pioneered now standard social-scientific approaches to mechanisms, contentious politics, and state construction. To understand Charles Tilly is therefore to understand the last fifty years of historical and comparative social science.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710001246","543-549","Mark Lichbach","University of Maryland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2047","686"

Nevertheless, these variables are rarely used in econometric analysis of democratization. Why? One important reason is a tendency to view subjective mass orientations as volatile, relatively &#8220;soft&#8221; data. Analyzing data from many Large-N comparative survey projects, this article demonstrates that: (1) certain mass attitudes that are linked with modernization constitute attributes of given societies that are fully as stable as standard social indicators; (2) when treated as national-level variables, these attitudes seem to have predictive power comparable to that of widely-used social indicators in explaining important societal-level variables such as democracy; (3) national-level mean scores are a legitimate social indicator; and (4) one gets maximum analytic leverage by analyzing data from the full range of societies. We find numerous strong correlations between these subjective indicators and important societal attributes such as democracy, which suggest that causal linkages exist&#8212;but we do not attempt to demonstrate them here. Previous research has tested some of these linkages, finding support for causal interpretations, but conclusive tests of all the linkages shown here would require several book-length treatments. We briefly review some of the evidence supporting the conclusion that modernization leads to enduring mass attitudinal changes that are conducive to democracy.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710001258","551-567","Christian Welzel","Jacobs University, Bremen","Ronald Inglehart","World Values Surveys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","9810","4442"

Shifting his attention back and forth from theory to practice, Spragens constructs an argument that liberalism will not recoup its political fortunes until it rediscovers its &#8220;populist heart&#8221; (p. xvii). Bearing some resemblance to previous treatises by Richard Rorty and Michael Sandel (along with important differences that Spragens notes), Getting the Left Right is provocative and powerful as theoretical critique and advocacy, but is less effective in providing a historical explanation for contemporary liberalism's troubled state.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710000472","620-622","Bruce Miroff","SUNY Albany","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","634","91"

And only half of its 1600 institutional subscribers are North American. At the same time, the contemporary political science discipline that it represents, however cosmopolitan, is deeply rooted in the distinctive historical experiences of the United States. As Ira Katznelson and Helen V. Milner observed in their 2002 Centennial edition of Political Science: State of the Discipline, the professional association responsible for publishing the words you are now reading was born in the United States during the Progressive Era, as an effort to more scientifically and thus more usefully understand the evolving American state and its national citizenship: &#8220;American political science has specialized in developing particular kinds of social knowledge. The modifier American has to be taken seriously&#8221; (3&#8211;4).","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271000201X","733-736","Jeffrey C.

That new policy sets up our exploration of whether and how multiracialism is entering Americans&#39; understanding and practice of race. By analyzing briefly earlier cases of racial construction, we uncover three factors important to understanding if and how intensely a feedback effect for racial classification will be generated. Using this framework, we find that multiracialism has been institutionalized in the federal government, and is moving toward institutionalization in the private sector and other governmental units. In addition, the small proportion of Americans who now define themselves as multiracial is growing absolutely and relatively, and evidence suggests a continued rise. Increasing multiracial identification is made more likely by racial mixture&#39;s growing prominence in American society&#8212;demographically, culturally, economically, and psychologically. However, the politics side of the feedback loop is complicated by the fact that identification is not identity. Traditional racial or ethnic loyalties and understandings remain strong, including among potential multiracial identifiers. Therefore, if mixed-race identification is to evolve into a multiracial identity, it may not be at the expense of existing group consciousness. Instead, we expect mixed-race identity to be contextual, fluid, and additive, so that it can be layered onto rather than substituted for traditional monoracial commitments. If the multiracial movement successfully challenges the longstanding understanding and practice of &#8220;one drop of blood&#8221; racial groups, it has the potential to change much of the politics and policy of American race relations.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002057","737-759","Vesla Mae Weaver","University of Virginia and the Miller Center of Public Affairs.

Opinion entrepreneurs (primarily business and conservative groups and individuals, often working through web sites) set the story in motion as early as 2006, the conservative echo chamber orchestrated an anti-ACORN campaign in 2008, the Republican presidential campaign repeated the allegations with a more prominent platform, and the mainstream media reported the allegations without investigating their veracity. As a result, the little-known community organization became the subject of great controversy in the 2008 US presidential campaign, and was recognizable by 82 percent of respondents in a national survey. We analyze 2007&#8211;2008 coverage of ACORN by 15 major news media organizations and the narrative frames of their 647 stories during that period. Voter fraud was the dominant story frame, with 55 percent of the stories analyzed using it. We demonstrate that the national news media agenda is easily permeated by a persistent media campaign by opinion entrepreneurs alleging controversy, even when there is little or no truth to the story. Conversely, local news media, working outside of elite national news media sources to verify the most essential facts of the story, were the least likely to latch onto the &#8220;voter fraud&#8221; bandwagon.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002069","761-792","Christopher R.

By attempting to restructure the political economy involved in taxation, higher education policy, and health care, Obama ventured into a policy terrain that presents immense obstacles to reform itself and to the public&#39;s perception of its success. Over time the submerged state has fostered the profitability of particular industries and induced them to increase their political capacity, which they have exercised in efforts to maintain the status quo. Yet the submerged state simultaneously eludes most ordinary citizens: they have little awareness of its policies or their upwardly redistributive effects, and few are cognizant of what is at stake in reform efforts. This article shows how, in each of the three policy areas, the contours and dynamics of the submerged state have shaped the possibilities for reform and the form it has taken, the politics surrounding it, and its prospects for success. While the Obama Administration won hard-fought legislative accomplishments in each area, political success will continue to depend on how well policy design, policy delivery and political communication reveal policy reforms to citizens, so that they better understand how reforms function and what has been achieved.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002045","803-824","Suzanne Mettler","Cornell University.

The Obama administration&#39;s proposed reforms pit common (largely unorganized) interests against well-organized and wealthy minority interests. I describe how the withering and unfolding of financial reform has occurred not through open institutional opposition but through a quieter process that I call institutional strangulation. Institutional strangulation consists of much more than the stoppage of policies by aggregation of veto points as designed in the US Constitution. In the case of financial reform, it has non-constitutional veto points, including committee politics and cultural veto points (gender and professional finance), strategies of partisan intransigence, and perhaps most significantly, the bureaucratic politics of turf and reputation. These patterns can weaken common-interest reforms, especially in the broad arena of consumer protection.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002070","825-846","Daniel Carpenter","Harvard University.

Absent a strong countervailing political constituency like organized labor, well-organized and more powerful stakeholders like business and industry groups are able to exert undue influence in American democracy, thereby frustrating attempts at political reform. I argue that it is impossible to understand the current political situation confronting the Obama administration without an account of the underlying sources of labor weakness in the U.S. In such an account two factors loom especially large. One is the role of the state in structuring labor market institutions and the rules of the game for labor-business interactions. The second is the distinctively racialized character of the U.S. political economy, which has contributed to labor market segmentation, a unique political geography, and the racial division of the U.S. working class. In our current post-industrial, post-civil rights racial and economic order, whether and how the labor movement can overcome its historical racial fragmentation will determine its possibilities for renewal and ultimately its political strength in relation to the Obama presidency. If the labor movement remains an uneven and weak regional organization hobbled by racial fragmentation, the Obama Administration&#39;s efforts to advance its core policy agenda will lack the necessary political force to be effective.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002082","847-860","Dorian T.

Why did it take the form it did&#8212;a form that, while undeniably ambitious, was also more limited than many advocates wanted, than health policy precedents set abroad, and than the scale of the problems it tackled? And why was this legislation, despite its limits, the subject of such vigorous and sometimes vicious attacks? These are the questions I tackle in this essay, drawing not just on recent scholarship on American politics but also on the somewhat-improbable experience that I had as an active participant in this fierce and polarized debate. My conclusions have implications not only for how political scientists should understand what happened in 2009&#8211;10, but also for how they should understand American politics. In particular, the central puzzles raised by the health reform debate suggest why students of American politics should give public policy&#8212;what government does to shape people&#39;s lives&#8212;a more central place within their investigations. Political scientists often characterize politics as a game among undifferentiated competitors, played out largely through campaigns and elections, with policy treated mostly as an afterthought&#8212;at best, as a means of testing theories of electoral influence and legislative politics. The health care debate makes transparent the weaknesses of this approach. On a range of key matters at the core of the discipline&#8212;the role and influence of interest groups; the nature of partisan policy competition; the sources of elite polarization; the relationship between voters, activists, and elected officials; and more&#8212;the substance of public policy makes a big difference. Focusing on what government actually does has normative benefits, serving as a useful corrective to the tendency of political science to veer into discussions of matters deemed trivial by most of the world outside the academy. But more important, it has major analytical payoffs&#8212;and not merely for our understanding of the great health care debate of 2009&#8211;10.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002021","861-876","Jacob S.

This would ensure that my hypotheses and findings were resonant with a longitudinal understanding of how black nationalist ideology is characterized.

However, his import as a dominant voice in black political thought belies the fact that there was ideological and fervent opposition to his view concerning how blacks could overcome racial oppression.

In the background is the sound of one or another cable news announcer, reminding me, for the thousandth time, that this coming weekend is the ninth anniversary of &#8220;9-11.&#8221; Controversy still rages over the plans of Muslim American citizens of the US to build a community center in lower Manhattan, two blocks from &#8220;ground zero&#8221; (or is it &#8220;Ground Zero&#8221; in deference to its apparent sacralization?). At the same time, attention has recently turned to an obscure Florida pastor, one Reverend Terry Jones, who has declared his intention to publicly burn copies of the Koran in protest of Islam and &#8220;commemoration&#8221; of 9-11. His plan has caused an outcry of opposition from national and local interfaith coalitions committed to religious and social pluralism, and provoked denunciations from a range of groups that include the Vatican and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Numerous high-ranking Obama Administration officials, from Attorney General Eric Holder to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have loudly criticized the proposed Koran burning as an affront to the American commitment to tolerance. Perhaps the loudest critic has been General David Petraeus, the US Commander in Afghanistan, who has insisted that such acts seriously undermine the US military in its war against the Taliban. One of his assistants, Lt. General William Caldwell, nicely summed up this logic in a CNN interview: &#8220;There is no question about First Amendment rights; that is not the issue. The question is: What is the implication over here? It is going to jeopardize the men and women serving in Afghanistan.&#8221;","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710003142","1001-1004","Jeffrey C.

The Dilemmas of Freedom of Expression and Democratic Persuasion","Hate groups are often thought to reveal a paradox in liberal thinking. On the one hand, such groups challenge the very foundations of liberal thought, including core values of equality and freedom. On the other hand, these same values underlie the rights such as freedom of expression and association that protect hate groups. Thus a liberal democratic state that extends those protections to such groups in the name of value neutrality and freedom of expression may be thought to be undermining the values on which its legitimacy rests. In this paper, I suggest how this apparent paradox might be resolved. I argue that the state should protect the expression of illiberal beliefs, but that the state (along with its citizens) is also obligated to criticize publicly those beliefs. Distinguishing between two kinds of state action&#8212;coercive and expressive&#8212;I contend that such criticism should be pursued through the state&#39;s expressive capacities in its roles as speaker, educator, and spender. Here I extend the familiar idea that law, to be legitimate, must be widely publicized; I contend that a proper theory of the freedom of expression obligates the legitimate state to publicize the reasons that underlie rights, in particular reasons that appeal to the entitlement of each citizen subject to coercion to be treated as free and equal. My theory of freedom of expression is thus &#8220;expressive&#8221; in two senses: it protects the entitlement of citizens to express any political viewpoint, and it emphasizes a role for the state in explaining these free-speech protections and persuading its citizens of the value of the entitlements that underlie them.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710003154","1005-1019","Corey Brettschneider","Brown University.

I argue that diversity liberals have a more justifiable view than that of autonomy liberals on cultural accommodation, but diversity liberalism too should reframe its view of exit rights. Narrow exit rights that protect basic human rights should be maintained and augmented with entrance paths into general society. I further suggest that for exit rights along with entrance paths to provide the morally required conditions for accommodating culture while respecting freedom, policies in this realm should be designed to address adults rather than children.

Felony disenfranchisement reveals a dark face of American liberal democracy that is distinct from two more familiar narratives: the Tocquevillean story of a triumphal and inclusionary liberalism and the &#8220;multiple traditions&#8221; account proposed by Rogers Smith that sees liberalism battling with racial and other exclusionary ideologies. The history of felony exclusion points to a third perspective: a hyphenate American liberalism (liberal-ascription; liberal-republicanism) in which an exclusionary politics is embedded within liberalism itself. We develop this argument with specific reference to the ways in which liberalism as an abstraction is reflected in concrete advocacy debates over reform, in court decisions, and in the legislative domain. We identify three strands of liberal argumentation&#8212;the conceptualization of discrimination that relies on intentionality; the paradigmatic liberal belief in the social contract; and the liberal-republican adherence to norms of individual responsibility. The three strands show how the purportedly universal and impartial liberal embrace of individuality, contract, and responsibility, that ostensibly transcends the ascriptive barriers of birth has nevertheless fostered laws and policies that buttress the boundaries of an exclusionary American citizenship.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710003178","1035-1054","Katherine D.

Moreover, and at a more fundamental level, practitioners are frustrated that academics just don&#39;t seem to &#8220;get&#8221; the policy world. Conversely, academics bemoan the fact that practitioners often fail to fully think through the problems they claim need to be solved.

I also agree that this is a challenging task. But my sense of why this is both important and challenging differs from Mosser's in some key respects. Despite qualifications along the way, Mosser's account suggests that academia has a particular responsibility to make itself legible and available to military policy makers, but not the other way around. As he explains, his topic grew from a project concerned about &#8220;whether the academy is asking militarily interesting questions.&#8221; And he proceeds by thinking about how academic scholarship might be &#8220;more tightly integrated&#8221; with the doings of military policy and planning. Undertaking bridge-building by firstly asking how the US academy can be more effectively leveraged to support national security goals sets up a largely one-sided and unilateral engagement, where the burden is primarily on academia to explain itself to the military policy community, and probably to do so within a frame of reference sensible to the policy crowd but not necessarily vice-versa. This sets up, in short, a scenario making it less likely for policy makers to listen to what academics might be saying, particularly whenever this appears to complicate established agendas. From my point of view, the best mutual outcomes flow from a more balanced dialogue. This includes policy makers taking academic frames at least as seriously when talking with them, so that greater clarity can be reached about how, and under what circumstances, scholarship might contribute to policy concerns, but also when academic contributions might be inappropriate, irrelevant, or even impossible.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710003208","1087-1093","Robert Albro","School of International Service, American University.

Let's call it by its name: a prejudice. Too many academics think that senior military people are hawks, and not particularly smart or thoughtful ones.

However, this gap is more one of degree than scope, and is therefore amenable to reconciliation. Mosser finds that the tenure process for academics is a significant obstacle to such reconciliation. He concludes by identifying several ongoing and proposed initiatives, including the Pentagon's Minerva Project and the Army's operational design concept, to integrate more fully the efforts of academics and military practitioners.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710003257","1117-1121","Paul Yingling","George C.

It is difficult for many reasons, including the recent increase in political polarization that has been widely criticized. We argue that the resistance to compromise cannot be fully appreciated without understanding its source in the democratic process itself, especially as conducted in the U.S. The incursion of campaigning into governing in American democracy&#8212;the so called &#8220;permanent campaign&#8221;&#8212;encourages political attitudes and arguments that make compromise more difficult. These constitute what we call the uncompromising mindset, characterized by politicians&#39; standing on principle and mistrusting opponents. This mindset is conducive to campaigning, but not to governing, because it stands in the way of necessary change and thereby biases the democratic process in favor of the status quo. The uncompromising mindset can be kept in check by an opposite cluster of attitudes and arguments&#8212;the compromising mindset&#8212;that inclines politicians to adapt their principles and respect their opponents. This mindset is more appropriate for governing, because it enables politicians more readily to recognize and act on opportunities for desirable compromise.

He is a social scientist, first, who hopes that the U.S. intelligence community (IC) will learn from its mistakes by adhering to sound social scientific practices. Jervis offers striking comparisons between the IC's failure to predict the overthrow of the Shah of Iran with the events of 1978&#8211;79&#8212;which the author assessed in a declassified internal review for the Central Intelligence Agency&#8212;and the erroneous judgment that Iraq had stockpiled biological and chemical weapons and was reconstituting its nuclear program, which the Bush administration used to justify the 2003 Iraq war. Drawing predominantly from these cases, Jervis argues that critical deficiencies in intelligence result because analysts fail to articulate their assumptions, subject these arguments to appropriate scrutiny, consider rival hypotheses that fit the evidence, test arguments by offering predictions, consider negative and positive evidence when evaluating assertions, and seek information that might disconfirm their existing point of view.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002240","1167-1169","James H.

The first itself has two parts, one being how scholars can study intelligence. Both access and methods are difficult. For years, diplomatic historians referred to intelligence as the &#8220;hidden dimension&#8221; of their subject. Now it is much more open, and Great Britain, generally more secretive than the United States, has just issued the authorized history of MI5 (see Christopher Andrew, Defend the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5, 2009). Since the end of the Cold War, the CIA has released extensive, if incomplete, records, and the bright side (for us) of intelligence failures is that they lead to the release of treasure troves of documents, which can often be supplemented by memoirs and interviews. But even more than in other aspects of foreign policy analysis, we are stuck with evidence that is fragmentary. In this way, we resemble scholars of ancient societies, who forever lament the loss of most of the material they want to study.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002252","1169-1170","Robert Jervis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","756","150"

By Daniel Jordan Smith","I first came upon Daniel Jordan Smith's remarkable book as I was close to finishing my own book on corruption (Corruption, Inequality, and the Rule of Law, 2008). I had decided that I needed to include an analysis of Africa and especially Nigeria. At the publisher's booth at one or another political science convention, I was able to secure page proofs of his book and realized that I had come upon a kindred spirit. Smith's argument on Nigeria was remarkably similar to my general framework for analyzing corruption, despite our coming from different disciplines and using very different methodologies.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002288","1175-1176","Eric M.

The exchange between us highlights for me, above all, the benefits of reading and conversing across disciplinary boundaries. Uslaner correctly notes that my book refers relatively little to a vast political science literature on corruption. My aim was to understand corruption in Nigeria as it is experienced by ordinary citizens, rather than to contribute to Western analytical debates about (possibly) more universal aspects of corruption and its consequences. But I certainly acknowledge and accept that my own analysis and understanding (as well as the larger contribution of my book) would have benefited from a deeper engagement with the political science literature on corruption. I would quibble with his contrast between anthropologists' &#8220;stories&#8221; and political scientists' &#8220;data.&#8221; To me, real people's lives and narratives are among the most powerful data in the social sciences&#8212;but that is why I am an anthropologist.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759271000229X","1176-1177","Daniel Jordan Smith","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","575","116"

By Eric M Uslaner","Eric Uslaner's ambitious book argues that&#8212;across a wide range of countries and contexts&#8212;the fundamental underlying engine and explanation for corruption is inequality. Mustering an array of sources, including survey data, comparative literatures, and personal anecdotes, Uslaner makes a compelling case that the faith often placed in relatively simplistic institutional changes as a means for combating corruption is misguided. Such approaches ignore the deeply embedded economic and social underpinnings of corruption, which, he argues, are tied less to political institutions (narrowly conceived) and more to systematic inequality and the economic and cultural processes that support it.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002306","1177-1178","Daniel Jordan Smith","Brown University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","675","172"

These issues are the relationship between petty and grand corruption and the need for a greater historical perspective.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592710002318","1178-1179","Eric M.

This symposium examines the consequences of this &#8220;international regime complexity&#8221; for subsequent politics. What analytical insights can be gained by thinking about any single agreement as being embedded in a larger web of international rules and regimes? Karen Alter and Sophie Meunier&#39;s introductory essay defines international regime complexity and identifies the mechanisms through which it may influence the politics of international cooperation. Short contributions analyze how international regime complexity affects politics in specific issue areas: trade (Christina Davis), linkages between human rights and trade (Emilie Hafner-Burton), intellectual property (Laurence Helfer), security politics (Stephanie Hofmann), refugee politics (Alexander Betts), and election monitoring (Judith Kelley). Daniel Drezner concludes by arguing that international regime complexity may well benefit the powerful more than others.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090033","13-24","Karen J.

This article argues that overlapping institutions influence trade politics at three stages: selection of venue, negotiation of liberalization commitments, and enforcement of compliance. First, lobby groups and governments on both sides of a trade negotiation try to choose the set of rules that will favor their preferred outcome. WTO rules that restrict use of coercive tactics outside of the WTO generate a selection process that filters the most difficult trade issues into WTO trade rounds or dispute adjudication while easier issues are settled in bilateral and regional fora. This selection dynamic creates a challenge at the negotiation stage by disaggregating interest group pressure for liberalization commitments. The narrowing of interest group lobbying for the multilateral process may impede negotiation of liberalization agreements that could only gain political support through a broad coalition of exporter mobilization. At the enforcement stage international regime complexity creates the potential for contradictory legal rulings that undermine compliance, but also adds greater penalties for noncompliance if reputation effects operate across agreements.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090045","25-31","Christina L.

The presence of nested and overlapping institutions creates incentives for rival political actors&#8212;whether states, institutions, or policymakers&#8212;to (1) forum shop for more power, (2) advantage themselves in the context of a parallel or overlapping regime, and (3) invoke institutions &#225; la carte to govern a specific issue but not others.

The prior existence of NATO shaped the conceptualization and organization of ESDP at its creation, and the existence of two alternative security institutions continues to influence the ways that the institutions evolve&#8212;how each institution defines security interests and how member states adjust the mandate of each institution to address changes in the security environment. Because both institutions are intergovernmentally organized and consensus-based, the actions and decisions of both institutions reflect the agreements of members.

The refugee regime mainly comprises the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Recently, however, new parallel and overlapping institutions have emerged in relation to two previously unregulated areas: internally displaced persons (IDPs) and international migration. This institutional proliferation has affected both state strategy and IO strategy in relation to refugee protection. It has enabled Northern states to engage in regime shifting. They have used the new institutions to prevent refugees reaching their territory, thereby avoiding incurring UN rules on refugee protection, and transferring burdens to Southern states. The resulting reduction in international cooperation in the refugee regime has contributed to UNHCR fundamentally redefining its strategy in order to become more relevant to Northern states. In particular, it has pursued states into the migration and IDP regimes into which they have shifted through a combination of stretching its mandate, engaging in the politics of the emerging regimes, and issue-linkage. The article&#39;s analysis draws attention to the potentially significant relationship between institutional proliferation and IO adaptation and change.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090082","53-58","Alexander Betts","MacArthur Foundation-funded Global Migration Governance project.

The Effects of Having Multiple International Election Monitoring Organizations","As the pressure to invite international election monitors rose at the end of the Cold War, states refused to grant the United Nations a dominant role. Thus, today multiple intergovernmental, regional, and international non-governmental organizations often monitor the same elections with equal authority. This article examines the costs and benefits of this complex regime to highlight some possible broader implications of regime complexity. It argues that the availability of many different organizations facilitates action that might otherwise have been blocked for political reasons. Furthermore, when different international election monitoring agencies agree, their consensus can bolster their individual legitimacy as well as the legitimacy of the international norms they stress, and thus magnify their influence on domestic politics. Unfortunately the election monitoring example also suggests that complex regimes can engender damaging inter-organizational politics and that the different biases, capabilities, and standards of organizations sometime can lead organizations to outright contradict each other or work at cross-purposes.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090094","59-64","Judith Kelley","Duke University.

Some of the posited effects of international regime complexity have contradictory or cross-cutting effects. Further effects of regime complexity&#8212;cross-institutional strategizing, the asymmetrical distribution of legal and technical expertise, and the fragmentation of reputation&#8212;can erode the significance of institutions in complex environments.

This thin notion should be replaced by a richer understanding of homo politicus that includes the characteristic activities of political actors: we fight, we feel, we talk, and we build institutions. This understanding helps illuminate the scope and limits of strategic action, argument and persuasion in world politics in both empirical and normative senses. I describe the spectrum of political action that situates the role of argument and persuasion within the extremes of brute force on one side and mutual communication on the other. I also discuss barriers to argument and communication. Noting the role of argument in this spectrum of international and domestic political practice suggests that it is argument (nearly) all the way down and that the scope of argument can be and in some cases has increased over the longue dur&#233;e. Coercion, by itself, has a limited role in world politics. The claim that there are distinctive logics of argumentation, strategic action, or appropriateness misses the point. Argument is the glue of politics&#8212;its characteristic practice. Understanding politics as argumentation has radical empirical and normative implications for the study and practice of politics.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090136","103-124","Neta C.

To probe these dynamics, I turn to the American jeremiad, a longstanding form of political rhetoric that explicitly invokes the past and laments the nation&#39;s falling-away from its virtuous foundations. I begin by focusing on the Christian Right&#39;s traditionalist jeremiad, which offers both nostalgic and Golden Age rhetoric in its assessment of the United States&#39; imperiled national promise. I argue that, despite differences in the historical location of their ideals and the significant rhetorical power that they bring to political life, such nostalgic and Golden Age narratives represent a constraining political ideal, one ultimately incapable of doing justice to an increasingly diverse American society. I argue furthermore that there is another strand of the American jeremiad and conclude by sketching a different way of drawing on the past, a progressive jeremiad epitomized by the thought of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Such a jeremiad is also deeply rooted in the American tradition and offers a far more promising contribution to a diverse and pluralistic American future.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090148","125-141","Andrew R.

Commentators have noted that the incoming Obama administration offers the possibility of a new and more cooperative way of negotiating and regulating differences in our domestic politics and in world politics. Whether this comes to pass is of course an open question. As political scientists our job is to keep such questions open, to proffer our own hypothetical and revisable answers to them, to foster an academic and perhaps even a public culture where these questions can be seriously, freely, and constructively debated, and to place such contemporary questions in a broader historical and theoretical context.

The Incentive to Supply Global Public Goods. By Scott Barrett. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2007. 280p. $45.00.","Public goods, as economists use the term, are &#8220;nonrival&#8221; (one person's consumption does not make it unavailable for others) and, typically, &#8220;nonexcludable&#8221; (if the good is provided to one person, others cannot be prevented from enjoying it as well). The classic example is the lighthouse, whose warning light goes out to and benefits all ships. Economists devote special attention to public goods because markets do not deliver them efficiently. Rational, self-interested actors realize that if anyone else provides this good, they can have it without paying for it. The incentives favor &#8220;free riding.&#8221; Others, however, see the same opportunity and so public goods go underprovided. There is thus a strong case for collective action to furnish public goods. Where collective benefits outweigh the costs of provision, government action can make society as a whole better-off.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090173","155-156","Kerry Whiteside","Franklin and Marshall College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","949","237"

By Marc Howard Ross. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007. 384p. $91.00 cloth, $34.99 paper.","Amid the steady stream of quantitative and game-theoretical studies of conflict published in recent years, Marc Howard Ross's Cultural Contestation in Ethnic Conflict comes as a welcome reminder of the ineffably human dimensions of conflict and violence around the world. His panoramic account of ethnic conflict goes beyond the establishment of statistical correlations and the modeling of &#8220;iterated games&#8221; to trace the complex processes by which conflicts emerge, escalate, and unravel, as well as the role of culture and identity in these processes. Making sense of ethnic conflict, Ross shows, requires an understanding of meaning&#8212;of how symbols, rituals, places, and events evoke emotions, inspire narratives, and inform identities in diverse settings around the world. The research agenda he pursues and promotes is thus in no small measure ethnographic and interpretivist, focusing on the (inter)subjective (self-)understandings of participants in ethnic conflicts, rather than the ostensibly objective conditions under which conflicts unfold.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090215","159-161","John T.

Sidel's thoughtful review of my book raises two important, intertwined issues that I focus on here: the nature of group identity and the differences he sees between interpretivist and poststructuralist accounts of ethnic conflict. He offers two views of ethnic groups: One argues that strong identities and a sense of groupness precedes, and forms the basis for, conflict, and the other asserts that identities are necessarily incomplete, inadequate, and accompanied by anxiety, and that conflict is constitutive of ethnic identities. He attributes the former position to me while suggesting that I ignore the latter.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090227","161-161","Marc Howard Ross","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","701","114"

For example, under Suharto's 30-year rule, corruption soared, but so did economic growth. In Riots, Pogroms, Jihad, John Sidel offers another false generalization for consideration, namely, that despite the rise of ethnic and religious violence in the world since 1990, the widespread religious violence experienced in Indonesia since the mid-1990s is not best understood as part of a global trend. Rather, he argues that &#8220;such broad-brush accounts offer little to illuminate the specific modalities of religious violence observed in Indonesia or to help examine the discernable but seemingly inexplicable shifts &#8230; in the forms, targets, processes of mobilization, and consequences of this violence in successive periods&#8221; (p. 11).","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090239","161-163","Marc Howard Ross","Bryn Mawr College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","981","214"

By Ivan Ermakoff. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2008. 440p. $99.95 cloth, $27.95 paper.","&#8220;Why would a group legitimize its own subservience and, in doing so, abdicate its capacity for self-preservation?&#8221; is the question asked at the start of Ruling Oneself Out (p. xi). Focusing on the Center Party's vote for the enabling act of March 1933, which gave Hitler the right to amend the Weimar constitution, and on the Vichy parliament's vote to grant full powers to Marshal Philippe P&#233;tain in 1940, Ivan Ermakoff studies how these decisions looked to the actors themselves, and finds that the pervasive uncertainty that characterized the situation leading up to each vote, and the actors' tendency to look to their peers for guidance, complicate monocausal accounts of groups marching to their death. Many prevalent attempts to explain these seemingly inexplicable collective actions tend to emphasize coercion, miscalculation, and collusion. Each of these explanations has its merits, and some are more persuasive than others. Yet each has its problems. Coercion, for example, which is the most compelling explanation of the lot, might lead one to expect those threatened to submit, yet fear just as often causes consolidation and vigorous collective resistance to the challenger.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090252","164-165","Ioannis D.

I address this question by considering two parliamentary decisions of crucial historical significance: the parliamentary surrenders of constitutional authority in Germany (March 1933) and in France (July 1940). These events have paradigmatic value because they are clear-cut cases of collective abdications and because they lend themselves to explanations that seem as obvious as they are commonsensical. People abdicate because they face coercive pressures. They abdicate because they misjudge the consequences of their action. Or they abdicate because their ideology predisposes them to do so.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090264","165-165","Ivan Ermakoff","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","731","113"

By Ioannis D. Evrigenis. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007. 256p. $85.00.","This book may be read from two complementary and enlightening perspectives: as a history of political thought centered on the role played by fear in group formation, and as a theoretical treatise on &#8220;negative association,&#8221; that is, collective action based on a principle of identification in opposition to others. Both perspectives sustain each other. The first draws attention to a rich and insightful reinterpretation of classical and lesser-known texts. The peculiarity of this history of political thought is that it records not inflection points but continuity and resilience. The second perspective is intended to bring about positive knowledge. This conflation of genres is an appealing facet of the book. In tracing a continuity of thought, Ioannis Evrigenis purports to demonstrate the validity of a theoretical claim about the centrality of negative association. By the same token, the historical expos&#233; lays bare the set of premises that sustains the claim.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090276","165-167","Ivan Ermakoff","University of Wisconsin at Madison","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","651","106"

As Ermakoff points out, the continuity of negative association in the history of political thought is striking, and this continuity is an important part of my argument about the role of negative association in collective action and the lessons that ought to be drawn from this. The precise nature, extent, and limits of this continuity, however, are indispensable parts of my story, ones that Ermakoff leaves out. As I note in Fear of Enemies and Collective Action, when one looks more closely, one realizes that the genealogy of negative association consists of episodes of action and reaction. The thinkers I study agree about much, but they also disagree quite strongly. Taken together, the continuity and disagreement show that it is a mistake to consider the discourse, as Ermakoff does, to be simply atemporal and represented by any single thinker.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090288","167-167","Ioannis D.

In a series of provocative publications beginning in 2006, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt address what they call &#8220;the Israel Lobby&#8221; and detail what they see as the dire consequences that that lobby has generated for American foreign policy making. In our lead essay here, Robert Lieberman challenges Walt and Mearsheimer in precisely the way I think debate on their thesis needs to proceed. Lieberman focuses on the causal claims Walt and Mearsheimer advance, the evidence they adduce for those claims, and the ways that their arguments fit with established research on how American politics operates. Mearsheimer and Walt have written a spirited response to Lieberman who, in turn, offers a brief reply. It is safe to say that neither party to this exchange has persuaded the other. Yet, though their exchange is frank, both Lieberman and Mearsheimer and Walt keep their eye on the ball&#8212;they are concerned to establish whether and to what extent the Israel lobby exists and operates in the way Mearsheimer and Walt claim it does.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090768","233-234","James Johnson","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","634","165"

Nevertheless, they observe that American foreign          policy regarding the Middle East, especially in recent years, has tilted          strongly toward support for Israel, and they attribute this support to the          influence of the &#8220;Israel lobby&#8221; in American domestic          politics. Their book is principally an attempt to make a causal argument about          American politics and policymaking. I examine three aspects of this          argument&#8212;its causal logic, the use of evidence to support hypotheses,          and the argument&#39;s connection with the state of knowledge about American          politics&#8212;and conclude that the case for the Israel lobby as the          primary cause of American support for Israel is at best a weak one, although it          points to a number of interesting questions about the mechanisms of power in          American politics. Mearsheimer and Walt&#39;s propositions about the direct          influence of the Israel lobby on Congress and the executive branch are generally          not supported by theory or evidence. Less conclusive and more suggestive,          however, are their arguments about the lobby&#39;s apparent influence on the terms          and boundaries of legitimate debate and discussion of Israel and the Middle East          in American policymaking. These directions point to an alternative approach to          investigating the apparent influence of the Israel lobby in American politics,          focusing less on direct, overt power over policy outcomes and more on more          subtle pathways of influence over policy agendas and the terms of policy          discourse.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270909077X","235-257","Robert C.

In addition to mischaracterizing our arguments, Lieberman claims that our methodology and research design are flawed and that our work contradicts the scholarly literature on American politics. Neither claim is true. Contrary to what he says, we did consider alternative hypotheses, and our analysis contains significant variation on both the independent and dependent variables. Given the methodological challenges involved in assessing the causal influence of any interest group, we also relied heavily on &#8220;process-tracing.&#8221; Lieberman recognizes this is an appropriate method for assessing causal impact and he concedes that this evidence supports our central argument. Moreover, we went to some lengths to avoid selection bias. Similarly, our arguments are consistent with the existing literature on interest groups, and with much of the scholarly literature on congressional decision-making, campaign financing, electoral politics, and the role of think tanks and the media.

But they begin, tellingly, by citing a range of indirect evidence that appears to depict a powerful &#8220;Israel lobby.&#8221; Lots of knowledgeable Washington insiders, they say&#8212;policymakers, journalists, candidates for office, and the like&#8212;say and do things that seem to acknowledge the &#8220;lobby's&#8221; power. I draw attention to this opening for several reasons. First, it is not clear how much weight some of this evidence will bear. Take, for example, the National Journal survey of members of Congress that Mearsheimer and Walt cite twice in their reply (and once in their book). In this survey, conducted once, in 2005, seventy-three members of Congress (out of 535&#8212;less than 15 percent) responded to the question, &#8220;Which two interest groups do you believe are most effective on Capitol Hill?&#8221; Of these respondents, thirteen (less than 20 percent of the sample) mentioned American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) as one of their two choices. It seems something of a leap from the observation that a dozen or so members of Congress said once that AIPAC is &#8220;effective&#8221; (which might mean any number of things) to the inference that AIPAC&#8212;or the lobby more generally&#8212;is powerful. Or take the observation that important politicians regularly address AIPAC's annual conference and make friendly speeches when they do. Surely these same politicians visit other such organizations regularly. And when they appear before, say, the AFL-CIO or the NAACP, surely they say nice things about the issues that these organizations and their conference attendees care about. Successful politicians rarely voice open disagreement with the people they are talking to. But are we to conclude from this behavior that the AFL-CIO and the NAACP, or any other groups that regularly receive such visits, are powerful? Again, this inference requires something of a logical leap.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090793","275-281","Robert C.

They rarely reflect on the following contradictions between their theory and their practice: if there is a &#8220;real world&#8221; impervious to political thought, why bother to try to influence it? And, is realist theory not putatively disconfirmed by the fact that realist thinkers have so often opposed existing foreign policies (e.g., the wars in Vietnam and Iraq)? I argue that these contradictions are not inherent in realism per se so much as in the commitment of contemporary realists to naturalistic methodological and epistemological postulates. I show that Hans Morgenthau and especially E. H. Carr, far from being na&#239;ve &#8220;traditionalists,&#8221; have grappled with these questions in a sophisticated manner; they have adopted non-naturalistic methodological and epistemological stances that minimize the tension between realist theory and the realities of realists&#39; public activism. I conclude with a call for contemporary realists to adjust their theory to their practice by trading the dualism underlying their approach&#8212;subject-object; science-politics; purpose-analysis&#8212;for E. H. Carr&#39;s dictum that &#8220;political thought is itself a form of political action.&#8221;' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090823","283-301","Ido Oren","University of Florida.

Hence, the ramifications of theories in the real world are mostly the result of political uses and, at times, political abuses. Consequently, theorists cannot be held morally responsible for these. They do, however, bear the obligation to examine if there are some intrinsic features of theorization and theory that render these susceptible to public misinterpretation and vulnerable to political abuse. Pointing to the rhetorical capital inherent in theories, and supported by examples involving democratic-peace theory and its political destinies, I conclude that, to discharge this task, social science theorists should substitute the prevailing objective ethic with a normative one.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090811","303-316","Piki Ish-Shalom","Department of International Relations, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Less emphatically stated but clear enough from the book's content and its structure is an important contribution to political science's &#8220;culture wars&#8221; over the use of different types of evidence, especially the sometimes competing claims for the primacy of country knowledge, game-theoretic modeling, and large cross-national data sets. In particular, Bates uses a deductive approach, where game-theoretic approaches are married to national outcomes through a deep immersion in the literature and intuition (a concept he clearly seeks to rehabilitate) and then tested by the use of a significant and original database that is nonetheless relegated to an appendix. This is a particularly important approach because no one would accuse Bates of being at all hostile to large-scale quantitative analysis. Indeed, the significant data collection at Harvard's Africa Research Program (<a href='http://africa.gov.harvard.edu' title='http://africa.gov.harvard.edu'>http://africa.gov.harvard.edu), which he helped found, is a service to the discipline.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709210863","359-361","Jeffrey Herbst","Miami University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1476","665"

The decline in public revenues led elites to become more predatory, which caused an increase in political conflict by mobilizing opposition. Popular demands for political reform, along with increased international pressure for the same at the end of the Cold War, heightened elite insecurity and led to more predation. This had the effect of &#8220;provoking their citizens to take up arms&#8221; (p. 109). Further, state decline and national-level conflicts exacerbated simmering subnational conflicts, typically in the form of land disputes between locals and migrants from other tribes.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270922086X","361-363","James D.

Legal scholar and activist Boaventura de Sousa Santos argued quite cogently in 2007 that the struggle for global social justice is also a struggle for global cognitive justice (&#8220;Beyond Abyssal Thinking: From Global Lines to Ecologies of Knowledges,&#8221; Eurozine, at <a href='http://eurozine.com/pdf/2007-06-29-santos-en.pdf' title='http://eurozine.com/pdf/2007-06-29-santos-en.pdf'>http://eurozine.com/pdf/2007-06-29-santos-en.pdf). In order to succeed, this struggle requires a new kind of thinking. Such new thinking is apparent in many contemporary social movements, but academic training and practice inhibits our ability to appreciate the wisdom of those deemed less worthy to speak to the grand questions of our day.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090938","383-383","Jackie Smith","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","680","78"

By Peter J. Spiro. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. 208p. $29.95.","Peter J. Spiro's timely and highly accessible book encourages readers to reflect upon the contemporary meaning of citizenship. It could not have come at a better time. As I read it, I watched the collapse of the global financial system, which may really be just an aftershock of even more devastating global climate, food, and energy crises. At the same time, rather than coming together in a shared effort to respond to these multiple crises, Americans were entering the most polarizing phase of the presidential election. Sarah Palin is probably the first vice presidential candidate to suggest publicly that some parts of the country are &#8220;un-American,&#8221; but her words clearly reflected the sentiments of a significant portion of the U.S. public. Although it stirred some late-night television ridicule, Palin's remarks sparked little outrage or thoughtful and sustained public reflection about the broader implications of her statement. We should hope that the aftermath of the election will afford us a chance for such a dialogue on the nature of our national political community and its relation to the wider, global community. Beyond Citizenship should be required background reading for such a conversation.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270909094X","383-385","Jackie Smith","University of Notre Dame","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","647","89"

My only point of disagreement goes to the nature of a world that, if not truly postnational, has witnessed the dramatic rise of nonstate forms of association. On the one hand, the ability of individuals to more fully actuate identities not anchored in the state advances autonomy values. On the other hand, these nonstate forms of association should not be romanticized. They, too, will implicate exclusion and conflict.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090951","385-386","Peter Spiro","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","826","59"

In this fresh, insightful, and creative study, Daniel Aldrich explores the ways in which states decide to site controversial facilities and the types of instruments that public agencies employ to respond to societal opposition against these siting decisions.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090963","386-388","Alexander Cooley","Barnard College, Columbia University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","579","97"

By Alexander Cooley. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2008. 321p. $29.95.","On September 5, 1995, three United States military personnel abducted and raped a 12-year-old schoolgirl on Okinawa, an island in the Pacific that houses roughly 75% of the U.S. military facilities in Japan. After a month and a half of smaller rallies, more than 85,000 demonstrators gathered in late October that year to protest not only the crime itself but also the presence of the U.S. bases on this string of islands that sit a thousand miles south of mainland Japan. Despite the enormous tragedy of this incident, the widespread international attention it received, and the Okinawan governor's refusal afterwards to renew land to the bases, more than 48,000 U.S. military personnel, their dependents, and civilians remain today on the island, which is roughly the size of Los Angeles. Tragedies at other U.S. bases overseas have similarly not altered the bilateral contracts with the host nation. In 1998, for example, a marine airplane accidentally severed a ski-lift cable for a gondola in Cavalese, Italy, killing all 20 passengers aboard, but this incident did not negatively impact the presence of the U.S. military in that nation.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709090987","389-391","Daniel P.

We evaluate two dominant views about public opinion on rising inequality: that Americans do not care much about inequality of outcomes, and that a rise in inequality will lead to an increase in demand for government redistribution. Using time series data on views about income inequality and social policy preferences in the 1980s and 1990s from the General Social Survey, we find little support for these views. Instead, Americans do tend to object to inequality and increasingly believe government should act to redress it, but not via traditional redistributive programs. We examine several alternative possibilities and provide a broad analytical framework for reinterpreting social policy preferences in the era of rising inequality. Our evidence suggests that Americans may be unsure or uninformed about how to address rising inequality and thus swayed by contemporaneous debates. However, we also find that Americans favor expanding education spending in response to their increasing concerns about inequality. This suggests that equal opportunity may be more germane than income redistribution to our understanding of the politics of inequality.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709990818","459-484","Leslie McCall","Northwestern University.

Content standards for the teaching of biology have been flashpoints for conflict, with well publicized battles occurring in state governments, in federal courts, and in local school districts. We show that a full understanding of evolution politics at the state level must simultaneously account for three important features. First, cultural politics typically includes an important role for public opinion. Second, scientists and their professional organizations have actively sought a monopoly on defining what is and is not science by marginalizing their uncredentialled opponents and by erecting boundaries that buffer science policy from the influence of politics and public opinion. Third, in the American federal system courts rarely settle cultural issues but merely narrow the space within which politics can operate. In accounting for these features, we explain why court victories for science have had only limited impacts and provide a model for understanding other issues&#8212;such as sex education, stem cell research, and global warming&#8212;in which moral and ideological arguments may conflict with scientific consensus.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270999082X","485-499","Michael B.

Analysis of Congressional scorecard data indicates only modest overlap among the issues identified by the minority advocacy groups, though there is complete &#8220;congruence&#8221; on the issues that are identified by both groups. The highest degree of &#8220;independence&#8221; of the activities examined occurs in Congressional testimony. Regarding legal advocacy, analysis of amicus curiae briefs further affirms the general finding that there is little if any outright competition between Black and Latino advocacy groups.

We rely on a new data set of gubernatorial races from the 1990s to address the theoretical and empirical challenges created by the interaction of gender, media content, and electoral institutions. Based on an analysis of 1,365 newspaper articles for 27 contests in which a woman held a major party nomination, we uncover evidence of continuing bias in media coverage. Yet significant coefficients on candidate sex tell only part of the story. Gendered contextual factors linked to the contest and state in which candidates compete, as well as the newspapers that cover their races, also affect women&#39;s experiences on the campaign trail. The major finding, however, is the presence of a powerful baseline effect favoring male candidates that is deeply embedded in U.S. politics. All else equal, women gubernatorial candidates suffer a substantial vote deficit that results from non-observable influences. The results support the emerging consensus among feminist theorists that greater focus on the political context is likely to produce bigger scholarly payoffs than is continued attention to observable differences between male and female candidates.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709990843","519-536","Jennifer L.

At the same time, presidential accomplishments are circumscribed by market forces and institutions at home and overseas, and the complexities of fragmented authority and external constraints make judging performance difficult. I draw on the literature on economic policymaking and on the presidency to explicate a set of criteria for comparing presidential economic policy leadership, construct quantitative indicators of each dimension, and display the results of comparative analyses covering the second half of the twentieth century. The four criteria view presidents from three different vantage points: the separation of powers, focusing on presidents&#39; success at gaining congressional approval for an economic agenda; the public, based on an original compilation of survey data tracking the electorate&#39;s evaluation; and the economy, tracing how presidents&#39; policies affect overall prosperity and the distribution of income. Combining information about how crucial audiences have perceived and responded to presidential initiatives, with outcomes in the economy, this approach emphasizes comparison, and thus complements the qualitative depth of narrative approaches.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709990855","537-560","M.

Until very recently almost everyone seemed to be convinced that the world was at the dawn of a new era. Yet, the issue at the heart of globalization debates&#8212;whether political forces can dominate economic ones or must bow before them&#8212;is not new at all. I show that many of the great ideological and political battles of the last century were fought over precisely this ground, and argue that because we have forgotten or misunderstood these earlier debates our current discourse is thin and impoverished. To understand where we are and where we are going, we have to first step back and look closely at where we have been.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709990867","561-578","Sheri Berman","Barnard College, Columbia University.

In so doing, the constructions of Al Qaeda as a decentralized corporation and a virtual network are often ignored. Corporate and network constructions place less stress on conventional threats to the nation-state and instead portray terrorism in distinctively post-Fordist terms. This in turn helps explain the short-lived and partial patriotic responses to the terrorist attacks, as well as the contradictory place of race in portrayals of the threat facing the U.S. Together these discourses point to new ways of thinking about U.S. nationalism and terrorism in the twenty-first century.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709990879","579-590","Catherine V.

The administration&#39;s central tactic for promoting this outcome was to help Boris Yeltsin remain in power. In a major assault on Clinton&#39;s historical legacy, much of the scholarly community maintains that U.S. policy was fundamentally flawed, both morally and strategically. In the view of these analysts, post-Soviet Russia&#39;s founding president was an autocratic leader who derailed the country&#39;s progress toward democracy. However, this body of research focuses exclusively on the Russian Federation and fails to utilize comparative referents. In contrast, we analyze the experiences of the full population of post-communist states of Eastern Europe and Eurasia from 1991 to the present. Whether examined in cross-national or longitudinal perspective, we find that Russian democracy under Yeltsin was, relatively speaking, a success. We conclude that the Clinton administration&#39;s policy of support for Yeltsin both served various American foreign policy interests and strengthened the prospects for democratic consolidation in Russia, thereby fulfilling the dictates of both real- and idealpolitik. In addition, the relative success of Russia&#39;s democratization in the 1990s, the reversal of that pattern in this decade, and the magnitude of the transformation of the polity under Putin all demonstrate the pivotal role played by presidential leadership in Russia&#39;s transition.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709990880","591-610","David W.

I offer three related arguments for why scholars should revisit the study of sub-state politics. First, the local level is the source of numerous political outcomes that matter because they represent a large proportion of political events in the United States. Secondly, there are methodological advantages to studying local politics. Finally, analyzing politics at the sub-state level can generate thoroughly different kinds of questions than a purely national-level focus and can offer different answers to questions that apply more generally. Research on local politics can and should contribute to broader debates in political science and ensure that we understand both how and why cities are unique.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592709990892","611-618","Jessica Trounstine","Princeton University.

But borders, land, ports, and peoples can each be contextualized by their location, which is neither random nor arbitrary. Rather, they result from and impinge upon the everyday ebb and flow of politics and economics. This welcome volume goes against the grain of much quantitative research in international relations and examines some aspects of the role of geography in the conduct of foreign policy and the attendant implications for international politics. It builds beyond a growing tradition in quantitative IR of including some geographical explanations in empirical investigations to actually focusing on a particular aspect of how the relation of states to territory affects their behaviors.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080547","210-211","Michael D.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007. 436p. $35.00.With the United States currently fighting protracted wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq, the question of what it means to achieve victory in war has never been more important for U.S. foreign policy. While policymakers, scholars, and military strategists have studied for millennia how to achieve victory in armed conflict, VictoryinWar seeks to provide an answer to a more fundamental question: What precisely is the meaning of victory in war and how do we know when victory is achieved? William C. Martel begins this book with the basic premise that there is currently no theory, framework, or set of organizing principles for understanding victory, yet paradoxically, &#8220;the implicit assumption [is] that the unalloyed purpose of [war] strategy is to achieve it&#8221; (p. 3). To address this glaring omission, the author sets out to develop a &#8220;pretheory&#8221; of victory, which entails the organization of principles about victory that can provide an analytic foundation for examining the concept of victory more systematically.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080535","209-210","Eric A.

Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 2007. 368p. $59.95 cloth, $29.95 paper.For the past 30 years, policy innovation in the United States and much of the industrialized world has centered on &#8220;liberalizing&#8221; markets and allowing competitive forces to unleash human creativity and flexibility. Legislators have relaxed restrictions on competition in telecommunications, banking, airlines, and a variety of other markets, ostensibly to enhance the efficiency of each market and thereby benefit both consumers and producers. This wave of &#8220;deregulation&#8221; has had a decidedly mixed track record. The easing of U.S. banking restrictions in the 1980s, for example, facilitated a host of financial innovations within the sector, but also contributed to the disastrous savings-and-loan crisis of the late 1980s. The deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s was deemed a success for consumers, but the promotion of competition in electricity markets in the 1990s was less successful.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080511","207-208","David Andrew Singer","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","805","203"

They do so by assisting &#8220;the integration and socialization of nonliberal states in the international community&#8221; (p. 252). In BeyondCompliance, Ann Kent argues that earlier pessimistic predictions about Beijing's participation in international organizations are unwarranted. Since 1971 when China regained its seat in the United Nations, it has generally played a constructive role in multilateral diplomacy.

She maintains that interstate relations are multidimensional and that conflicts should be seen as only one aspect of interstate relations.

Conceiving changes in the &#8220;three Is&#8221;&#8212;interests, ideas, and institutions&#8212;as the three central components of an explanation of this policy change, she presents a series of chapter-length studies focused on each of these elements. She further divides the chapters into &#8220;demand&#8221; and &#8220;supply&#8221; sections&#8212;with the former tending to emphasize the role of shifting interests, and the latter primarily devoted to discussions of ideology as revealed by parliamentary speeches. Like many who have preceded her, Schonhardt-Bailey studies very closely the proceedings in the House of Commons, but she breaks new ground by also studying the approval of repeal in the House of Lords. (That the latter chamber, dominated in 1846 by the landed aristocracy, would nonetheless not block repeal is even more remarkable than Prime Minister Robert Peel's success in the House of Commons.) She also examines the relationship between the discussion of repeal in local newspapers and the floor votes of members of Parliament (MPs)&#8212;a particularly apposite topic given the close relationship between these newspapers and the political parties of the day, and the lack at that time of any national news media.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080420","196-197","Tim McKeown","University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","718","136"

By Norman Schofield and Itai Sened. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 248p. $70.00 cloth, $24.99 paper.The elegant median voter result of the Downsian model of electoral competition&#8212;which suggests that in order to maximize votes, parties move towards the ideological center&#8212;does not entirely translate into multiparty systems. To begin with, as Charles Plott (&#8220;A Notion of Equilibrium and Its Possibility under Majority Rule,&#8221; AmericanEconomicReview 57 [no. 4, 1967]: 787&#8211;806) shows, an equilibrium generally does not exist in multidimensional spaces. Moreover, Gary Cox (&#8220;Centripetal and Centrifugal Incentives in Electoral Systems,&#8221; AmericanJournalofPoliticalScience 34 [no. 4, 1987]: 903&#8211;35) demonstrates that if an equilibrium does exist in multicandidate contests, then they must be noncentrist. But multiparty politics are even more complex, as one must consider which coalition will govern following the election and what policy it will implement. These considerations may in turn affect the voters' strategies and the parties' choice of platforms.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080419","195-196","Indridi H.

By Bo Rothstein. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 256p. $80.00 cloth, $30.99 paper.How do you get from Moscow to Stockholm? That is, how do you create efficient, honest government like that of Sweden as opposed to the incompetence and corruption found in Russia? This question drives Bo Rothstein into an analysis of the causes of social traps&#8212;situations where actors cannot cooperate due to mutual distrust, even if cooperation is mutually beneficial. Eliminating social traps requires generalized trust, that is, social capital. How does one engender trust? Robert Putnam, both in MakingDemocracyWork (1993) and BowlingAlone (2001), argues that social capital is created through civil society, a process that bubbles up through history and culture. Rothstein takes this view to task for not analytically distinguishing between associations (a behavior) and trust (a belief), for it is really the belief that needs to be generated. Trust, in his view, need not evolve organically from below; it can be generated from above by establishing efficient political institutions. If public officials are corrupt, citizens will infer that people in general are dishonest and behave dishonestly themselves. Thus, social traps are sprung. The reverse is also true: Honest governance begets social trust.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080407","193-195","Terrence Casey","Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","802","231"

It asks one of the key questions of contemporary political economy: how to explain the rise of neoliberal economic policies in advanced industrialized countries. It answers this question by considering the rise of neoliberal policies in four countries&#8212;Britain, France, Germany, and the United States&#8212;in three policy areas&#8212;taxation, welfare, and industrial policy. Although the book's main focus is on important moments of policy change in the 1970s and 1980s, it considers these in the light of the preceding postwar period and uses them to illuminate more recent events. It notes that although in retrospect it may seem natural that the United States and the UK would have become neoliberal and France and Germany not, this was not at all obvious at the time. Much the contrary, since both the United States and the UK in the 1970s had more progressive tax policies, more egalitarian welfare states, and more anti-business industrial policies than France or Germany. The puzzle, then, is how to explain the transformations in all four countries, which left the United States and the UK much more neoliberal in tax policies, less egalitarian in welfare states, and arguably more pro-business.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080390","192-193","Vivien A.

That is the central question addressed by this book. The authors challenge the earlier scholarship that doubted the likely success of simultaneous marketization and democratization. Since economic reforms impose high costs on existing politically powerful sectors (such as state-owned firms and agriculture), the argument went, groups associated with these sectors will oppose reforms, making transition difficult.

Structural Marxism, modernization theory, and transition theory all lead us to expect that strong economic growth (markets and, to a significant extent, privatization), the emergence of a middle class, and the presence of fragmentation within the Chinese leadership might very well unleash forces of democratization. Of course, twentieth-century capitalism does not replicate the Anglo/American experience in which the bourgeoisie is seen to have ushered in democratic institutions, and so some scholars would argue that there is no conundrum to be explained. Nevertheless, the expectation that China's economic transformation will encourage pro-democratic forces persists among those who do and do not know China well.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080353","188-189","Margaret M.

It also provides a comparison with the other Latin American federations, Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil.

It is quite unusual for a single author to show such mastery over various country contexts. The book could easily have been written by several authors as it carefully covers and interprets labor laws in six Latin American countries, focusing mainly on the period in which flexibilized labor policies were implemented. Maria Lorena Cook couples countries that share historical and institutional similarities, namely: Argentina and Brazil are chosen as having legacies of state corporate systems; Chile and Peru represent postradical regimes; and Mexico and Bolivia experienced revolutionary pasts. Introductory overviews on labor reform in Latin America and concluding comments on where these countries stand today between flexibility and rights act as bookends for the paired country chapters. This is a skillful exegesis of pertinent documents, voluminous secondary literature, and expert testimony concerning two decades of labor laws after the restitution of democracy in the postauthoritarian period in these countries&#8212;unfinished as that process continued to be in Peru and Bolivia (at the time of the book's completion in 2005).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270808033X","186-187","Peter Ranis","City University of New York","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","699","134"

On the basis of the assumption that courts are independent of the political process and can exercise judicial review to protect &#8220;discrete and insular&#8221; minorities from the tyranny of the majority, it is assumed by many&#8212;especially those in the legal academy&#8212;that the judiciary is the best-situated governmental institution to protect individual rights under the U.S. Constitution.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 213p. $55.00 cloth, $19.99 paper.The landscape of marriage in the United States is changing yet again, driven this time by tensions over the rights of same-sex couples to marry. States across the nation have revisited their laws in recent years to clarify the legal rights and responsibilities of same-sex couples, with widely divergent outcomes. Massachusetts permits same-sex couples to marry, currently the only state to do so. Six other states grant same-sex couples all the state-level rights and benefits of marriage, typically under the name of civil unions. On the flip side, 26 states have amended their constitutions expressly to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples; 17 also bar the establishment or recognition of alternative legal regimes designed to give the substantive rights of marriage to same-sex couples. One additional state, Hawaii, amended its constitution to give the state's legislature the sole ability to decide who may marry, a move that successfully derailed a constitutional challenge to the state's existing marriage regime. The federal government has also gotten into the game. The 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) limits marriage to opposite-sex couples for all federal purposes and authorizes states to opt out of recognizing same-sex marriages validly performed in other jurisdictions.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080286","179-181","Ellen Ann Andersen","Indiana University Purdue University&#8211;Indianapolis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2088","727"

Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2006. 208p. $64.50 cloth, $21.95 paper.These two books on the American welfare state seek to challenge conventional understandings of redistributive policy and politics in the United States. Christopher Howard does so by looking at the many tools of social policy that, he argues, have been downplayed or ignored in most academic research. In addition to the well-known social insurance and transfer programs such as Social Security and public assistance, he argues, tax expenditures subsidizing private welfare provision (e.g., child tax credit), regulatory policies, minimum wage laws, tort laws, housing loan guarantees, and entities such as the Pension Benefits Guarantee Corporation should all be included within the definition of the welfare state. Doing so reveals that the American welfare state is not a &#8220;chronic underachiever&#8221; but, in fact, &#8220;large and far-reaching&#8221; (p. 1). Howard cautions, however, that this heterogeneous mix of social policy tools does not make the American welfare state particularly effective. On the contrary, given enduringly high rates of poverty and widening income inequality in this country, the welfare state is paradoxically both extensive and limited in its ability to address some of the greatest social problems in the United States.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080274","177-178","Kimberly J.

Published in 1903, Souls includes nine previously published articles among its 14 chapters. This accounts for the prevailing tendency to view the text as a compilation or collection of discrete pieces, and the related inclination to focus on specific parts and themes rather than the whole. Hence, W. E. B. Du Bois is widely credited (rightly) for the concept of double-consciousness, but such appropriation tends to pluck the singular treasure from its setting. And this constitutive setting, the text conceived as &#8220;an intricate and coherent narrative, indeed as an organic whole and even at times as a living presence&#8221; (p. 2), is what Wolfenstein proposes to reconstruct.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080237","171-172","Christine Di Stefano","University of Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","710","118"

In short, to what extent is effective and enduring political governance reliant on the development of forms of credibility, or &#8220;credible commitment,&#8221; among citizens and between citizens and political institutions? The problem of trust has been central to political inquiry at least as far back as Hobbes and arguably Aristotle, for whom civic &#8220;friendship&#8221; was an indispensable condition of politics.

Many scholars find evidence that these implicit messages work and that they have racializing effects. However, the biggest study to date finds that racial messages&#8212;implicit or explicit&#8212;have no effects. In this paper I conduct a thorough review of several relevant literatures in order to adjudicate between these competing claims. I find that the large study&#39;s null findings conflict with 17 public opinion experiments involving over 5,000 subjects, 2 aggregate studies, and a large social psychology literature. Using different methods, samples, and settings, these studies show that racial cues do in fact racialize opinion. I explain the large study&#39;s null results by noting that its participants perceived only small differences across messages, that racial predispositions were measured just before exposure to the ad, thereby neutralizing the effect of the ad&#39;s racial cue, and that WebTV studies such as this one have failed to provide many subjects with their assigned ad. Thus, the weight of the evidence heavily favors the racial effect of racial cues and messages. I offer several directions for future research on racial communication and politics. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080092","109-123","Tali Mendelberg","Princeton University (<a href=mailto:talim@princeton.edu>talim@princeton.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3458","1375"

We use standard, qualitative analytical methods on primary, in-depth interview data collected from fathers&#39; rights members, and compare that with in-depth interview data drawn from fathers with children on welfare. In brief, we find three overlapping perceptions in this policy area: child support awards are economically hurtful to fathers, child support obligations are not adjusted for other types of support, and child support enforcement discourages parental cooperation. However, we also show that while there is broad overlap in terms of the general nature of these complaints, each group&#39;s members use very different language to describe their difficulties. Fathers&#39; rights members are much more likely to remain connected to the system, and while challenging current policy, do not champion lawbreaking as a viable means of demonstrating their opposition. Fathers with children on welfare, on the other hand, speak in terms that reflect their disconnection from these policies, and frequently reveal their subsequent choice to engage in evasive and even illegal behavior as viable means of expressing their dissatisfaction. Finally, we conclude that these different ways of speaking about public policy problems can have important implications for policymaker responsiveness, and ultimately, each group&#39;s political inclusion in a democratic society. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080079","71-88","Margaret Watson","The Edward J.

Indeed, most IR scholars share this &#8220;anti-realist assumption.&#8221; To determine the empirical validity of the anti-realist assumption, this paper re-examines survey and experimental data on the mass public&#39;s attitudes towards foreign policy priorities and world views, the use of force, and foreign economic policy over the past three decades. The results suggest that, far from disliking realism, Americans are at least as comfortable with the logic of realpolitik as they are with liberal internationalism. The persistence of the anti-realist assumption might be due to an ironic fact: American elites are more predisposed towards liberal internationalism than the rest of the American public. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080067","51-70","Daniel W.

Some observers interpret the protests as signs of a &#8220;moral vacuum.&#8221; Others see the unrest as signaling a powerful new &#8220;rights consciousness.&#8221; In either case, the protests are often regarded as a major challenge to the stability of the political system. In this article, an examination of Chinese conceptions of &#8220;rights,&#8221; as reflected in the ethical discourses of philosophers, political leaders, and protesters (and as contrasted with American understandings of rights), provides the basis for questioning prevailing assumptions about the fragility of the Chinese political order. For over two millennia, Chinese political thought, policy, and protest have assigned central priority to the attainment of socioeconomic security. As a result, the meaning of &#8220;rights&#8221; in Chinese political discourse differs significantly from the Anglo-American tradition. Viewed in historical context, China&#39;s contemporary &#8220;rights&#8221; protests seem less politically threatening. The Chinese polity appears neither as vacuous nor as vulnerable as it is sometimes assumed to be. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080055","37-50","Elizabeth J.

Empirical studies of contemporary political parties and party systems tend to have little to say about the meanings and possibilities of democracy, and therefore also about the varied potential roles of political parties within it. Meanwhile, contemporary democratic theorists quietly sidestep the issue of whether political parties perform a legitimate function in democracies. This lack of mutual engagement is regrettable, in particular given the pervasive erosion of popular support and legitimacy of political parties as representative institutions. In this article we explore the key reasons for democratic theorists and scholars of political parties so rarely taking on each others&#39; core concerns, and we outline the key ways in which this mutual disengagement is mutually impoverishing. We will also suggest ways forward, by pinpointing and illustrating potentially productive areas of engagement which might serve to deepen our understanding of democracy&#39;s present and its possible futures. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080043","21-35","Ingrid van Biezen","University of Birmingham, UK (<a href=mailto:i.c.vanbiezen@bham.ac.uk>i.c.vanbiezen@bham.ac.uk)","and Michael Saward","Open University, UK (<a href=mailto:m.j.saward@open.ac.uk>m.j.saward@open.ac.uk)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2456","1289"

However, events occur that cannot be linked to direct causes, leading human beings to invent beliefs and other mechanisms to produce a system of order and probability that can be applied to the seemingly random universe. Examining the relationship between Hobbes and the Book of Job reveals the failure of religion to provide for perfectly comprehensible causality since Job is forced to accept that God works in ways that he cannot understand in delivering rewards and punishments. Hobbes offers secular political order as an alternative that will conform to the structure of human reason. The attempt to order the universe is always incomplete, yet it is this lack of control that helps us to understand the inspiration to create and recreate political order, even when it fails to create a predictable, comprehensible environment. While the need for security is often seen as a malevolent or irrational element in political life, this article explains how the desire for order can also be understood as a dynamic interaction between the structure of human reason and the uncontrollable aspects of human life. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080031","11-20","Keally McBride","University of San Francisco (<a href=mailto:kdmcbride@usfca.edu>kdmcbride@usfca.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1374","755"

The theme is that the discipline of political science has benefited from imports from many other fields, but it also has a lot to offer in the way of exports to other fields. A personal example is the export of cooperation theory to cancer research. The main recommendation is to cultivate your curiosity by: reading up in a variety of fields so your mind will be well prepared, teaming up with others who can help you, loading up on research related to your problem, and lightening up when you need to escape from the problem for a while. Promising opportunities exist for political science to export to public health, cognitive and neuropsychology, and the design of web-based institutions. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270808002X","3-9","Robert Axelrod","University of Michigan (<a href=mailto:axe@umich.edu>axe@umich.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1553","677"

On Melissa Schwartzberg's account, &#8220;entrenchment,&#8221;&#8212;her term for those aspects of law thought not to be susceptible to revision by democratic majorities or to constitutional amendment by supramajoritarian procedures&#8212;damages democracy, despite its prevalence in modern history. She argues that entrenchment risks sedimenting law and deadening active democratic participation because it places crucial issues beyond debate. In resisting entrenchment, she aligns herself with J&#252;rgen Habermas's project of invigorating democratic constitutionalism as a &#8220;living project.&#8221;","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080705","363-364","Corey Brettschneider","Brown University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","707","104"

Whereas &#8220;proceduralists&#8221; seek to define democracy strictly through reference to the (majoritarian) means by which decisions are rendered, Brettschneider fears that this leaves democracy rootless, at risk of producing undemocratic outcomes. His effort at solving the problem of &#8220;democratic autophagy&#8221;&#8212;the argument that democracy will consume itself through its own procedures, as I term it in Democracy and Legal Change&#8212;is twofold. First, he specifies the values that democratic rights should reflect and preserve. Second, he argues that even nonmajoritarian institutions, such as judicial review, act in a democratic fashion insofar as they help us to ensure that our laws actually do cohere with these values. The former effort is remarkably successful. In my view, however, the latter claim is less persuasive, partially because of the difficulty inherent in translating abstract substantive commitments into law.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080687","361-362","Melissa Schwartzberg","Columbia University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","788","152"

Although critical evaluations are necessary, his essay falls short of what is required of a scientific critique on both empirical and theoretical grounds. We offer a comment on his essay and further contend that it is na&#239;ve to proceed on the assumption that a barrier exists between the biological and social sciences, such that the biological sciences have nothing to offer the social sciences.

Professor Charney, apparently as a result of the fact that genes and the environment interact in a complex fashion, advocates that this passive unawareness be replaced by active denial. Science, however, does not advance by avoiding important relationships merely because they are complicated and, fortunately, science is not heeding Charney&#39;s ideologically-based fears. Molecular geneticists, often working in tandem with political scientists, are quickly moving beyond twin studies to identify the specific suites of genes and biological systems that predict variation in core political preferences, whatever labels those preferences might be given in a particular culture at a particular time. We sympathize with the fact that our empirical findings, like those of so many behavioral geneticists, make Charney uncomfortable; still, his critique serves up nothing new&#8212;empirically or otherwise. Just as analyses of the roots of sexual preferences cannot presumptively ignore genetics, neither can analyses of the roots of political preferences.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080638","321-328","John R.

Their article has received an enormous amount of attention among political scientists and in the popular press.

We formulate a framework with which to conceptualize cheap labor in advanced democracies. We propose that to understand the politics of cheap labor, the weakest members of the labor market need to be divided into two structural groups: those in standard and those in nonstandard employment. Standard cheap labor includes &#8220;regular jobs&#8221; while nonstandard cheap labor includes low-cost, flexible, and temporary jobs. We show that the use of cheap labor is significant in all industrialized democracies but that there are important contrasts in how different economies use cheap labor. We argue that there is a trade-off between standard and nonstandard cheap labor. Countries that satisfy their need for cheap labor through standard employment do not develop large nonstandard sectors of their economies. Countries that do not promote cheap labor in the standard sector, on the other hand, end up relying on an army of nonstandard workers to meet their cheap labor needs.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080614","279-297","David Rueda","Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Oxford and Merton College.

In particular, many worry that religious conservatives lack the requisite civic virtues necessary to making pluralist democracies work. After attending to what sorts of virtues a good citizen ought to possess, we present evidence drawn from interviews with state-level religious conservative activists suggesting that political mobilization and integration into institutions of deliberation and electoral contestation actually works to make them better citizens, at least with respect to one important virtue, political autonomy. If such engagement can temporize the dangers politicized religion can sometimes pose, those concerned about religion&#39;s public influence might have their fears eased. Religious conservative activists can make for good citizens, fellow participants in the project of constructing a common political order that is durable, decent, and democratic.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080596","253-266","Kimberly H.

The four modes are differentiated by their internal construction and external social message. The central assertion is that there are standardized trajectories inherent to many of the empirical analyses we advance, which can be used to understand ongoing debates in the field. Perceiving inherent harmony or discord, emphasizing the exalted or the mundane, projecting achievement or frustration, the various narratives of American politics present contrasting interpretations regarding regime tensions and prospects. The more that political scientists become conscious of the forms and limits of the models employed, the more sophisticated we can be at developing and debating them.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080584","235-252","Ronald F.

Analysis of interviews with 80 female faculty at a large Research One university&#8212;the most comprehensive qualitative data set generated to date&#8212;suggests both individual and institutional discrimination persists. Overt discrimination has largely given way to less obvious but still deeply entrenched inequities. Despite apparent increases in women in positions of authority, discrimination continues to manifest itself through gender devaluation, a process whereby the status and power of an authoritative position is downplayed when that position is held by a woman, and through penalties for those agitating for political change. Female faculty find legal mechanisms and direct political action of limited utility, and increasingly turn to more subtle forms of incremental collective action, revealing an adaptive response to discrimination and a keen sense of the power dynamics within the university. Women attributed the persistence of gender inequality not to biology but to a professional environment in which university administrators care more about the appearance than the reality of gender equality and a professional culture based on a traditional, linear male model. Respondents described heart-wrenching choices between career and family responsibilities, with tensions especially intractable in the bench sciences. They advocated alternative models of professional life but also offered very specific interim suggestions for institutions genuinely interested in alleviating gender inequality and discrimination.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080572","215-233","Saba Ozyurt","University of California at Irvine","Ted Wrigley","University of California at Irvine","Amy Alexander","University of California at Irvine","Kristen Monroe","University of California at Irvine","","","","","","","","","","","","","10211","1899"

We spend a lot of time and effort arguing about those vantage points, the theoretical and methodological &#8220;perspectives&#8221; from which we explore our object of inquiry. Rarely, however, do we direct our attention reflexively and systematically on the ways our own practices and institutions themselves are infiltrated by politics. The lead article in this issue, a study of how gender inequality operates, sometimes subtly, sometimes much less so, among faculty and administrators at one prominent American university. As the authors Kristen Monroe, Saba Ozyurt, Ted Wrigley, and Amy Alexander note at the outset, not everyone immediately sees how this topic fits within a conception of politics. Like the authors, I find it difficult to grasp that perspective. Monroe, Ozyurt, Wrigley, and Alexander not only chart in an innovative manner the ways that women faculty at a prominent research university encounter gender inequality but the strategies they have devised for responding to the predicaments that inequality creates for themselves and their colleagues. I am pleased to be publishing this provocative study and hope that it will generate much subsequent inquiry into this topic.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708080560","213-214","James Johnson","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","993","199"

Numerous programs incorporating a &#8220;Hill&#8221; experience into a variety of academic disciplines have imitated it since then. However, scholarship in the subfield of international relations has not benefited from the opportunities the program offers to the same extent as other disciplines and subfields have. I use a sample of legislative and policy matters that I encountered as a fellow in the 2006&#8211;2007 year to argue that a wide spectrum of theoretical work in international political economy would profit from insights generated by the type of direct participation the program affords. Specifically, I connect literature across subfields on institutional change, and relate how my experiences with Darfur divestment legislation, Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) legislation, and politics in a financial crisis hold the potential to enrich our understanding of the international political economy. I suggest where more direct experience with other issues by other scholars could prompt additional insights for research on U.S. foreign policy and international relations.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081279","539-551","Kathryn C.

One of us argues that the implementation of these benefits, especially in the South, helped widen the income and wealth gaps between whites and blacks and further marginalized many African Americans; the other considers them to have been a rare example of a relatively inclusive policy, one that fostered equal citizenship. Because we are both historical institutionalists and we both share interests in matters of social policy, equality, and race, these dissimilar accounts require explanation. This dialogue first considers methodological issues, explaining our decisions about which forms of data to use and to emphasize, and how we made sense of contradictory findings. It next discusses interpretive matters, examining the processes through which we sometimes reached different conclusions even when we confronted the same evidence. Finally, the exchange considers some implications of our findings, probing the lessons they convey both about policy research and practice.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081267","519-537","Suzanne Mettler","Cornell University E-mail: <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:sbm24@cornell.edu>sbm24@cornell.edu</span>","Ira Katznelson","Columbia University.

We begin by articulating the philosophical distinction between naturalism and anti-naturalism. Whereas naturalism assumes that the study of human life is not essentially different from the study of natural phenomena, anti-naturalism highlights the meaningful and contingent nature of social life, the situatedness of the scholar, and so the dialogical nature of social science. These two contrasting philosophical approaches inspire, in turn, different strategies of concept formation. Naturalism encourages concept formation that involves reification, essentialism, and an instrumentalist view of language. Anti-naturalism, conversely, challenges reified concepts for eliding the place of meanings, essentialist concepts for eliding the place of contingency, and linguistic instrumentalism for eliding the situatedness of the scholar and the dialogical nature of social science. Based on this philosophical framework, we subject qualitative concept formation to a philosophical critique. We show how the conceptual strategies developed by Sartori and Collier embody a reification, essentialism, and instrumentalist view of language associated with naturalism. Although Collier&#39;s work on concept formation is much more flexible and nuanced than Sartori&#39;s, it too remains attached to a discredited naturalism.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081255","503-517","Asaf Kedar","University of California, Berkeley.

In doing so, liberalism violates its moral and epistemological commitment to &#8220;make public use of one&#39;s reason in all matters.&#8221; This article uses the framework provided by Carl Schmitt&#39;s concept of political theology to analyze the reluctance of liberals to ask questions of the executive in times of danger and uncertainty. That framework helps explain how both the content and the structure of liberal thought can shift in a theological (and specifically theistic) direction when faced with an emergency. This article demonstrates that the quasi-religious rhetoric sometimes used to justify expansions of executive power in practice has precedents in the theories of John Locke, William Blackstone, and Alexander Hamilton. Analysis of their writings suggests that the use of quasi-theistic language in discussions of emergency powers can have the effect of insulating &#8220;godlike&#8221; executives from the kind of scrutiny and criticism that liberalism usually promotes.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081243","487-501","Clement Fatovic","Florida International University.

Scholars have especially have focused on the ways modern states have been able to create and change ethnic identities, with perhaps the strongest case studies coming from colonial Africa, where the gap between strong states and weak societies has been most apparent. I suggest, however, that in order to better understand how and when ethnic change occurs it is important to examine case studies where state-directed ethnic change has failed. To rectify this oversight I examine the case of the &#8220;lost counties&#8221; of Uganda, which were transferred from the Bunyoro kingdom to the Buganda kingdom at the onset of colonial rule. I show that British attempts to assimilate the Banyoro residents in two of the lost counties were an unmitigated failure, while attempts in the other five counties were successful. I claim that the reason for these differing outcomes lies in the status of the two lost counties as part of the historic Bunyoro homeland, whereas the other five counties were both geographically and symbolically peripheral to Bunyoro. The evidence here thus suggests that varying ethnic attachments to territory can lead to differing outcomes in situations of state-directed assimilation and ethnic change.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081231","473-485","Elliott D.

Assessing the Decline of Establishment Internationalism in U.S. Foreign Policy","Is establishment internationalism in decline? Conventional wisdom is becoming that structural shifts in the international environment along with generational, demographic, and cultural changes within the United States are inexorably leading to the decline of the broad, post-war internationalist consensus that dominated American foreign policy after 1945. Despite the frequent assertion that this change has taken place, very few studies have analyzed the extent to which establishment internationalism is in fact in decline. To answer this question, we first track trends in congressional foreign policy votes from the American Conservative Union (1970&#8211;2004) and Americans for Democratic Action (1948&#8211;2004). Our second set of indicators tracks the state of birth, educational profile, and formative international experience of a cross section of the U.S. foreign policy elite. Our third and fourth sets of indicators track elite attitudes as represented by presidential State of the Union addresses and major party platforms. We find support for increasing partisan polarization in Congress on foreign policy as well as increasing regional concentration of the parties. However, there is only mixed evidence to suggest that internationalism has experienced a secular decline overall. Support for international engagement and multilateral institutions remain important parts of elite foreign policy rhetoric. Moreover, we find that social backgrounds of U.S. foreign policy elites&#8212;save for military service&#8212;have not substantially changed from the height of the internationalist era.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270808122X","451-472","Jonathan Monten","Harvard University.

The increasing dominance of the social conservatives has angered some prominent Republicans, even causing a number of them to change party allegiance. Over time, the decreasing significance of the economic axis may cause the Republican Party to adopt policies that are analogous to those proposed by William Jennings Bryan in 1896: populist and anti-business.

Arnold&#39;s review of Welfare Reform and Sexual Regulation","Let me begin by thanking Kathleen R. Arnold for her comments and Jeffrey Isaac for the invitation to participate in this exchange. Clearly, Kathleen and I are both indebted to the Marxist and Foucauldian traditions. For my part, however, I find the Gramscian insistence on the historically specific, complex, and contradictory character of every historical bloc and hegemonic institution more compelling than the social theories that envision the social structure as a closed totality (Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri) or construct state power in an ahistorical and one-dimensional manner (Giorgio Agamben). Contemporary welfare reform, for example, resembles the racially exclusionary &#8220;substitute father&#8221; rule of Aid to Families with Dependent Children. But welfare reform, with its workfare requirement, child support enforcement, family cap, fatherhood programming, abstinence education, and marriage promotion dimensions, is also somewhat unique. The Gramscian paradigm encourages us to be skeptical when it appears as if the state in a late-modern developed society is becoming either a simple instrument of capital that is obediently shrinking into irrelevance, or an omnipotent machine whose seamless coherence and unbroken continuity leaves democratic forces absolutely no strategic opportunity for constructing a counterhegemonic bloc and fighting back.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270808198X","815-816","Anna Marie Smith","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","843","113"

Yet we view political theory in different ways. Smith has focused on one set of programs and gives the reader a richly detailed view of recent welfare laws. In contrast, I have tried to do something very different. First, I use Giorgio Agamben's ideas as a foil, drawing upon Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault to supplement this reading, and I investigate the ideas of John Locke (rather than Thomas Hobbes) to understand sovereignty today. By looking at Locke, we can understand how representative government based on the rule of law and equality can coexist with prerogative power used systematically and domestically. Instead of a top-down view of power, I argue that modern power is characterized by the dispersal of sovereignty and, importantly, prerogative power (the legal suspension of the law). Thus, even as national borders have become more open (both with economic globalization and post-Clausewitzean forms of war), state sovereignty has not necessarily declined. In fact, the use of prerogative power increasingly characterizes late-modern power even as neoliberal rhetoric gives the opposite impression.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081966","813-813","Kathleen R.

Smith's aim is to &#8220;expand the disciplinary limits of feminist political theory&#8221; (p. 6) by drawing on case law, public policy, and social theory. She exposes highly undemocratic practices directed at poor women and men, as well as what amounts to a eugenic project seeking to limit poor people's reproduction. Significantly, individuals of color are targeted by the state for eugenic control and moral policing. In particular, Smith points out how welfare reform and the implementation of &#8220;paternafare&#8221;&#8212;a program that forces poor women to identify biological fathers so that the state can pursue these &#8220;deadbeat dads&#8221;&#8212;do not help the one group who even conservatives agree are &#8220;innocent&#8221;&#8212;children. Very rarely are any party's circumstances elevated by this system, and most often &#8220;payers&#8221; are forced into deeper poverty. Furthermore, the state's hetero-normative stance marginalizes lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgendered individuals (LGBTs) in a legal system in which their rights are already deeply compromised.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081978","813-815","Kathleen R.

John McCain's selection of little-known Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has taken the pundits by surprise, injecting new dynamics into the Presidential contest, and furnishing proof that political life is riddled with contingency. At the same time, the selection further accentuates, and perhaps even reduces to absurdity, a theme that has been at the heart of this campaign season largely due to the Democratic party primaries and their down-to-the-wire contest between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton&#8212;the politics of difference. If the Democratic contest demonstrated that the politics of race and gender are central not simply to the Democrats but to the U.S. as a whole, the Republican convention has made it all but inevitable that for the first time in the history of the U.S. an African-American has broken the color line in Presidential politics, a woman has broken the gender line in Republican Presidential politics, and come January 2009 there will be either an African-American man or an (Alaskan American) woman in the White House as either President or Vice-President. This is extraordinary. At the same time, before this contest plays out to its conclusion&#8212;long after this introduction goes to print, and before it reaches you&#8212;there will no doubt be much tortuous discussion&#8212;and also posturing and denunciation&#8212;of the politics of race and gender and of the ways that these identities intersect with broader claims of citizenship.","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081930","799-800","Jeffrey C.

When it comes to the equal environments assumption (EEA), the best approach is to test for and control possible violations of the EEA on heritability estimates rather than merely rejecting all empirical evidence because of the possibility of EEA violations. In many respects, since the study of the genetic basis of complex human behaviors now includes many methods in addition to twin studies, Beckwith and Morris&#39;s critique applies more to the behavioral genetics of a quarter century ago than to today&#39;s multifaceted behavioral genetics. Twin studies establish that there is a sizeable genetic component to political orientations, thereby giving cause to look further at the nature of that role by using other methodologies, including molecular genetics. We conclude by pointing out that the normative implications of the relevance of genes to human behavior are not nearly as worrisome as Beckwith and Morris seem to believe.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081929","793-797","John R.

Researchers have long used human twins in attempts to assess the degree of genetic influence on various behavioral traits. Today, this methodology has been largely replaced in favor of contemporary molecular genetic techniques, and thus heritability studies have seen a diminishing role in behavioral genetic research of the twenty-first century. One important reason the twin method has been superseded is that it depends upon several questionable assumptions, the most significant of which is known as the equal environments assumption. Alford, Funk, and Hibbing argue that this crucial assumption, and thus their conclusion, holds up under empirical scrutiny. They point to several studies in support of this assumption. Here, we review the evidence presented and conclude that these attempts to test the equal environments assumption are weak, suffering significant methodological and inherent design flaws. Furthermore, much of the empirical evidence provided by these studies actually argues that, contrary to the interpretation, trait-relevant equal environments assumptions have been violated. We conclude that the equal environments assumption remains untenable, and as such, twin studies are an insufficient method for drawing meaningful conclusions regarding complex human behavior.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081917","785-791","Jon Beckwith","Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Harvard Medical School.

To fulfill World Trade Organization Agreement on Basic Telecommunications commitments, many countries aim to create regulatory agencies that are &#8220;independent.&#8221; What characterizes independence? Regulators are embedded in a political context that includes three main constituencies : other government institutions, industry, and consumers. Independent regulators are able to take action autonomously from other government institutions and industry while serving as advocates for consumers. In a survey of 18 countries, several traits emerge; a leader who cannot be dismissed arbitrarily, regulatory authority clearly distinct from policymaking, independent funding, minimal staff exchange between regulator and regulated firm, and dedicated support for consumers. It is usually easier for a regulator to be independent if operators are privatized. In a study of 4 countries, independent regulators follow decision-making procedures that give the public notice about proposed rule changes, opportunities to provide comments, and final decisions with explanation. Also, independent regulators have gift, conflict of interest, and post-employment rules, which set ethical standards and expectations for staff.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081905","769-783","Irene Wu","School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University E-mail: <span class=nowrap><a href=mailto:irene_wu@post.harvard.edu>irene_wu@post.harvard.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2816","447"

Thus, the Asian American case presents new insight beyond the black politics model into how racial identification influences individual political attitudes and behavior. We present findings from a unique embedded survey experiment conducted in 2004 that reveals a surprising degree of malleability in Asian American racial group attachment. This is a striking contrast to the findings demonstrated by blacks whose racial identification is relatively more stable over various contexts. We seek to explain these findings by advocating for a more explicit consideration of the structural incentives and costs of adopting racial and ethnic identities by highlighting the significance of U.S. immigration policy and its role in creating group-based stereotypes and racial tropes.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081887","729-740","Jane Junn","Eagleton Institute of Politics, Rutgers University.

However, scholarship has continued to mislabel many of the specific policies in these organizations and governments as &#8220;affirmative action&#8221; policies, even though many such policies lack the civil rights roots necessary to warrant this label. In this article, I explain how many organizations have recast, supplemented, or replaced their rights-based affirmative action policies with utilitarian diversity policies. While the conventional, civil rights framework for analyzing affirmative action obscures the rise of such organizational diversity policies, an alternative body of scholarship that employs a diversity framework has shed light on the causes, content, and consequences of this policy and political realignment. The Supreme Court&#39;s 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger decision and the political activism surrounding Michigan&#39;s Proposal 2 in 2006 both exemplify the trademark signs of this shift from rights-based affirmative action to organizational diversity policies. The article concludes by assessing the promise and dangers of this trend of rooting racial inclusion policies in a utilitarian diversity logic rather than a civil rights logic.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592708081863","691-706","Daniel N.

At its most ambitious, the result can verge on a prepolitical or even apolitical view of constitution writing. To be sure, most liberal constitutionalists have backed away from the extreme view by increasingly recognizing that passion and bargaining will inevitably play a role in constitution writing. But few have moved beyond grudging acceptance of passion and bargaining to active incorporation. In addition, the terms themselves are used in increasingly slippery ways. Yet while greater terminological precision is desirable and possible, it cannot overcome a key feature of constitution drafting: reason and interest are easily confused in practice as are passion and rationality. Even if reason and deliberation over the public interest could be distinguished from passion and private bargaining, they are unlikely to be able to deliver what is demanded of them. Constitutional politics differs from normal politics less in the role for rationality and the public interest and more in the means used and the number of actors with veto power.

This examination is informed by recent debates in international relations theory on contractual and imperial network models of control, as well as work on non-territorial autonomy in the fields of nationalism and ethnic conflict. I examine the practical application of a dispersed control model in the context of the governance structure proposed for Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in February 2008.

Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006. 249p. $49.95 cloth, $19.95 paper.As human rights promotion gradually comes to rival development and democratization in the Western policy pantheon, more human rights&#8211;related books appear each year. Only a minority of these are empirically and methodologically rigorous, however, and even fewer are theoretically adventurous. Stephen Hopgood's unique study of Amnesty International is thus a welcome contribution from a political scientist with anthropological instincts, and it is likely to become a classic in the field. Hopgood immersed himself for over a year in Amnesty's culture, rituals, and politics, and then interpreted this data with insights from Emile Durkheim and Pierre Bourdieu. He writes clearly and well, and his interpretations should appeal to students of transnational organizing, human rights, and international affairs, broadly conceived.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070703","213-215","James Ron","Carleton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1234","308"

By Mark L. Haas. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2005. 250p. $39.95.Realists argue that state behavior is predicated on the distribution of power in the international system. Specifically, states attempt to acquire, maintain, exercise, and balance power in response to the same behavior expected of other states in the system. In this book, Mark L. Haas offers a compelling argument for thinking beyond power variables and considering the independent effects of ideology on leaders' foreign policy decisions. The main thrust of his thesis is that the greater the ideological distance between decision makers of different states, the greater the likelihood that they will view each other as threats to domestic power and international security. Conversely, the greater the ideological affinity between states' leaders, the greater the likelihood that they will see each other as mutually supportive of one another's interests and, therefore, as less threatening. Decision makers' conflictual or accommodative foreign policies, then, are a function of threat perception caused by ideological distance. The book begins with the explication of the theoretical argument and then applies the theory to five different historical case studies. Haas concludes with policy implications and prescriptions for current and future international politics generally, and U.S. foreign policy specifically.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070697","212-213","Steven B.

By Ivan Arreguin-Toft. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 250p. $75.00, cloth, $29.99 paper.The question of asymmetric conflicts or, more precisely, wars between two states of unequal power capabilities is an important one, but it has received scant scholarly focus, especially in the international relations field. More importantly, the subject of weaker actors winning wars against stronger adversaries has received limited attention. This is especially puzzling since during the Cold War, both superpowers experienced defeat or stalemate at the hands of weaker powers. In the case of the Soviet Union, an ill-fated asymmetric war in Afghanistan contributed to its demise as a state. America's failure in Vietnam had a major impact on U.S. domestic politics and foreign policy behavior for years to come. It affected American strategy regarding war in the developing world, encouraging the development of and reliance on new precision-guided weapons systems and strategies that would preclude ground combat. The failure of France in Indochina and Algeria also point to the significance of the phenomenon of asymmetric war. The Israeli and American withdrawals from Lebanon in 1982 and 1983 and India's pulling out from Sri Lanka in 1990 are other instances of stronger powers failing to make gains against their weaker adversaries. In the post-9/11 world, asymmetric conflicts have increasingly received the attention of military strategists as a result of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but they have not received commensurate attention from IR scholars.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070624","203-204","T.

In the early nineties I mentioned the work of Myron Weiner, a pioneer in thinking about the security implications of migration, to a scholar who later held a high immigration policy position in Washington, D.C. &#8220;A waste of time,&#8221; came the reply, &#8220;worse than that, positively damaging, because immigration has no important security implications and such talk only provides ammunition to anti-immigration activists.&#8221; In the wake of 9/11, that complacency has been shaken amid a groundswell of interest in security and migration, but there is in some quarters more resistance than ever to linking the two concepts. The recent literature is sharply divided over the legitimacy and necessity of policies that &#8220;securitize&#8221; migration policy and over the appropriateness of academic analysis set within a security framework. A major theme in the literature is the claim that the securitization of immigration policy is a repressive state strategy designed to capitalize on public fears in the post&#8211;Cold War era and to give security forces something to do now that keeping track of communist subversives is no longer on the table.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070612","201-203","Gary P.

The general theme is how some local democratic practices can develop within the People's Republic of China (PRC).

He draws on a rich data set that consists of 11 large-scale urban surveys conducted by Chinese government and academic institutions, including his own 1999 six-city survey. With this data he examines a wide range of theories and explanations, such as regime legitimacy (Chapter 3), the influence of the media on opinion (Chapter 4), social capital theory (Chapter 5), political participation (Chapters 6 and 7), and the role of intellectuals (Chapter 8).

Unfortunately, the book cover is nearly the only thing going for this sectarian jeremiad from James Petras and Henry Veltmeyer. If one is looking for serious scholarship, or even solid journalism, neither can be found here. Instead, one finds a poorly organized collage, including descriptions of recent history, critiques of government policies, and tendentious and contradictory evaluations of left strategy. Despite the promise of the title, the authors do not engage the literature on social movements, nor do they contribute much in the way of new analytical perspectives. The class analysis announced in the introduction only emerges occasionally in the subsequent chapters, and even then it is applied mechanically and reductively, yielding an extremely limited capacity to help us understand the character and trajectory of social movements or the nuances of political behavior in diverse contexts. Important cross-national differences in terms of political institutions, ethnic composition, and international constraints are not addressed, much less systematically compared. Furthermore, the book lacks consistent citations of sources, and serious empirical and orthographic errors are sprinkled throughout. Those knowledgeable about the countries in question might be amused by the almost congenital inability to spell correctly the names of politicians, political parties, and labor confederations; those without such knowledge, especially undergraduate students, will only be confused or misinformed.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070569","195-196","Benjamin Goldfrank","University of New Mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1270","381"

She builds on the institutionalist literature in political economy, but combines its best-known models of labor markets with other elements. As foundations, she takes the Calmfors-Driffil model, which stressed that unemployment varies with labor union centralization (since more centralized unions are better at delivering wage moderation), and the Soskice-Iversen model, which stressed that unemployment varies with the independence and policies of central banks (since union moderation is encouraged by nonaccommodating monetary policy, which adjusts to cancel out wage inflation that exceeds productivity growth). Mares notes, however, that in most cases, neither union centralization nor monetary policy institutions have varied as much as unemployment over time&#8212;leaving these models better able to account for cross-national variation than for cross-temporal patterns.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070533","192-193","Craig Parsons","University of Oregon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","887","184"

In this book, Michael MacDonald investigates the evolution of racism and racialism and their linkages to state legitimacy and governance.

Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006. 440p. $84.95 cloth, $23.95 paper.As a veteran of corruption studies in the postcommunist world, Leslie Holmes addresses three fundamental issues confronting students of corruption: the definition and categorization of corruption, the impact corruption has on democracies, and causal factors that account for its rise within postcommunist states. The comparative study focuses on Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Russia. China, the author argues, has developed a system akin to postcommunism and is treated in the analysis as far as data permit. The author also refers to other postcommunist cases, when appropriate, and many of the observations and inferences would apply to all democratic countries.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270707051X","189-191","Paul E.

By Paul R. Brass. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003. 448p. $50.00 cloth, $35.00 paper.Rioting in South Asia is commonly understood as a form of political activity, and the idea that it may not be spontaneous but planned is not a novel one. However, in TheProductionofHinduMuslimViolenceinContemporaryIndia, Paul Brass makes the more interesting claim that riot-prone cities are those that are marked by institutionalized systems that create, control, and direct the course of riots. He bases these ideas&#8212;developed in his earlier work TheftofanIdol&#8212;on four decades of research carried out in the northern Indian town of Aligarh, home to a sizable and historic Muslim community. Brass argues that polarizing issues or incidents by themselves do not lead to riots, but that a toxic mix of interested politicians, an existing discourse of communalism, an ineffective administration, and a specialized network that &#8220;produces&#8221; riots enhances the likelihood that such incidents will eventuate in riots. In describing this social construction of rioting, Brass highlights interesting features, such as the need for a group to dominate the narrative describing the riot, which establishes it as a defensive rather than offensive measure, thereby creating legitimacy for the violence.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070478","184-186","Milind Thakar","University of Indianapolis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","767","229"

While providing a lucid, readable, and persuasive analysis of the evolution of property relations in Russia during the 20 years from 1985, he avoids imposing artificially tidy theoretical schemes on the very messy processes he describes. Instead, he explores the full range of actors, institutions, strategies, and exogenous events that have shaped the struggle for property in Russia since the advent of Mikhail Gorbachev. This is above all a work of history&#8212;a theoretically informed history, but history nonetheless&#8212;and it is therefore a work in which contingency is sometimes important, and one in which the question of which actors shaped which outcome, and why, is always an empirical one&#8212;never something determined by an ex ante assumption. In place of a spare, highly theoretical explanation of this or that aspect of Russian privatization, Barnes offers a complex but nevertheless comprehensible account of how contests for control of real assets have evolved hitherto and where they may be headed in the future.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070454","181-182","William Tompson","Birkbeck College (University of London) and the OECD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","507","128"

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006. 296p. $50.00 cloth, $20.00 paper.Gary Mucciaroni and Paul Quirk have done the field a service by reminding us that Congress is a deliberative body, even if it is not always a good deliberative body. The authors foreshadow their findings, stating: &#8220;Congressional debate is only moderately realistic and informed. Listeners encounter a considerable volume of distortions, omissions, and even falsehoods, with apparent potential to mislead&#8221; (p. x). They base this conclusion on a study of effects claims made during three significant policy debates: Welfare Reform in 1995 and 1996, the Estate Tax Repeal in 1999 and 2000, and the Telecommunication Deregulation Act of 1996. Effects claims are claims made during debate about the likely effects of the legislation or amendment under consideration: Reforming welfare will reduce illegitimate births; current tax rates depress incentives to invest; deregulation will help the telecommunications industry grow. The heavy lifting in the book comes from the authors' assessments of the validity of these effects claims (and rebuttals) based on contemporary knowledge of the issues that would have been available to members of Congress.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070399","175-175","Paul S.

Like few others, she views the country's fundamental charter as announcing far more than a design for government institutions and a series of individual rights guarantees. The importance of the Constitution, she insists, extends deeper than can be captured by examining the text's most obvious features. It &#8220;creates and regulates a socialorder&#8221; (p. 8), a comprehensive understanding of public and private life. &#8220;The constitutional order acts as an instrument of social design,&#8221; claims Ritter; it endorses certain relationships over others, while also choosing to recognize certain members of the polity as privileged (p. 9). Traditional conceptions of the marital relationship or of the role of particular classes of people in the public realm, for example, are fostered and perpetuated by the constitutional scheme, not because the words of the text necessarily command it but because the nature of a constitution&#8212;an instrument that embraces a particular political and social order&#8212;makes it so.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070405","175-177","Beau Breslin","Skidmore College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","769","118"

In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, made no apologies about his willingness to consult with rulings from the European Court of Human Rights in holding that the Fourteenth Amendment's promise of due process of law forbids the state of Texas from prohibiting sodomy between consenting adults. Court observers should have seen this development coming: With the breakdown of the Soviet Union came the emergence of new Western-style democracies thrust into the position of building new republics from scratch. American constitutional scholars were called upon in the late 1980s and early 1990s to consult with officials from these countries and advise them on the drafting of their own constitutions. Constitutionalism is now a commodity that travels across international lines. The Supreme Court's controversial method in Lawrence may or may not signal the beginning of a new era of cross-national consultations by the high Court. However, it does coincide with a growing interest on the part of political scientists studying comparative law and comparative constitutionalism during the past decade.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070387","173-174","David Yalof","University of Connecticut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","801","183"

By Charles T. Clotfelter. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006. 216p. $55.00 cloth, $17.95 paper.Those who live or have lived in metropolitan areas that faced court-ordered desegregation of the schools in the latter part of the twentieth century have likely heard a common theory about the connection of those efforts to the state of the relevant city. It goes something like this: Once federal courts ordered city schools to desegregate, many white city dwellers either fled to the suburbs for protection or plucked their kids from city schools and enrolled them in private ones. Under the first scenario, the end of neighborhood schools negatively affected the city, as families in once-vital neighborhoods abandoned desegregating city schools they perceived as problematic for their children's education for virtually lily-white suburban schools thought to be of a higher quality. Under the second scenario, white parents remained in the city of their birth but undermined desegregation efforts by transferring their children to private schools (which were mostly Catholic in the Northeast and Midwest and mostly newly opened in the South). In the end, long-frustrated federal judges and civil rights leaders ultimately succeeded in increasing the levels of interaction between white and black children, but their efforts had significant side effects for those cities as well.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070338","167-169","Kevin J.

Because the first instance attacked the perceived consequences of epistemic relativism in the social sciences generally and the latter the rigor mortis resulting from an allegedly hegemonic notion of scientific rigor in its discipline in particular, Topper's conceit allows him to play the role of Odysseus steering through the straits, lashed to his hermeneutic mast while shunning the Manichean siren songs of scientific monism to the one side and empty pluralism on the other, and heading for more open, ecumenical waters. It also enables him to claim that all this tacking to and fro has a public, political import. Indeed, he asserts that his primary concern in this book is &#8220;with a set of contemporary questions about the ways in which particular methodological commitments enable or constrain one's capacity to identify and act upon opaque power relations that sustain forms of domination&#8221; (p. 12).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070284","161-162","Nicholas Xenos","University of Massachusetts at Amherst","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","666","121"

With their various tools, social scientists are testing and considering both deliberative democratic institutions (e.g., juries, town hall meetings, deliberative polls, and other fora for citizen discussion) and the preconditions of context and character that theorists have proposed are necessary to make deliberative democracy work. Political scientist Diana Mutz and sociologist Andrew Perrin have written new books purporting to bring empirical work to bear on the claims of deliberative democratic theory. Both books are short and illuminating, though their postures as serious challenges to deliberative democratic theory are overstated and potentially misplaced. This failure to undermine the enterprise of deliberative democracy, however, does not prevent each from making a serious contribution to helping us understand how citizens engage in political debate and discussion among themselves in their everyday environments.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070235","154-156","Ethan J.

First, the traditional faiths have shown a surprising vitality in reclaiming their respective space in the secular, public square. It is evident that faith movements cannot always be caged in pejorative stereotypes; secularization is not a linear process, and religious beliefs continue to shape ordinary people's lives and to have a say in public affairs. The increasing politicization of religion in many parts of the world has brought with it the challenge to engage Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as essential allies in the modern struggle for human rights, social justice, and enlightened thought. Second, the importance of religion in modern democracy and mass politics can be gleaned in an exadverso kind of way: Even when rejecting the mission of religion to give meaning to human existence, many politicians have found it useful to appropriate for themselves the trappings of religious symbols and rituals. This sacralization of politics has sought to interpret and to define human existence by subordinating the destiny of individuals and the collectivity to a supreme entity, liberal democracy, or totalitarianism.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070193","149-150","Filippo Sabetti","McGill University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1072","404"

This book belongs to what one might call the quantitative school of terrorism studies, as it relies mainly on data gathered on suicide attacks and their perpetrators over the last two decades. Its author takes issue with the conclusions of those who stress the importance of the doctrine of Islam in the shaping of the suicide terror phenomenon. Such a debate is part and parcel of a wider dispute within U.S. academia, boosted by 9/11 and its Iraqi aftermath, though it was already rooted in the &#8220;Orientalism&#8221; battle back in the 1980s. However, it also touches on an ongoing conflict between scholarship and partisanship: Should academics take sides and advocate specific policies, at the risk of submitting their scholarly credentials to the political goals they champion, or should they shun away from politics, at the risk of remaining clad in their ivory tower while social debates rage, uninfluenced by their expertise? The issue of terrorism is crucial to that matter. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Gilles Kepel is professor and chair of Middle East and Mediterranean Studies, Sciences Po, Paris.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707260128","137-140","Gilles Kepel","Sciences Po","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","761","250"

In the first instance, an intra-politicalscience conceptualization conventionally invokes the fields of international relations and comparative politics and then uses words like &#8220;intersection,&#8221; &#8220;inform,&#8221; and &#8220;complement.&#8221; Indeed, if comparative politics is traditionally viewed as the study of politics within countries (often with attention to a specific region of the globe) and international relations is preoccupied with the relationships between countries in the international arena, efforts to understand the politics of developing countries obliges IPE scholars to engage both fields. How can one understand the development experience of a country (or region) without situating it in a broader international context? Undeniably, a country's experience with its colonial legacy, the evolution of state institutions, economic growth, poverty, corruption, globalization, and natural resource exploitation can only be understood in the dynamic context of the international arena. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Gregory White is Associate Professor of Government at Smith College, Northampton, MA (gwhite@email.smith.edu).

Contemporary politics is distinctive not in the sloganeering quality of political discourse, but in the divergence between the quality of information available to society as a whole and the quality of information used in making decisions. For example, it was clear to any open-minded observer by the time of the Congressional vote in 2002 that implications of collaboration between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda lacked any basis in reliable evidence. By the time the Bush Administration initiated war in 2003, claims about Iraq's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons capabilities were also partially debunked and increasingly dubious.

The apparent success of the Court decision in spurring social change encouraged activists in other social movements to emulate the NAACP Legal Defense Fund&#39;s litigation strategy, and to adapt organizational structures, political strategies, and rhetoric borrowed from the civil rights movement. We examine how a Supreme Court decision and its subsequent interpretation influenced the development of other social movements. Borrowing from work on social movements, we contend that the Court decision signaled judicial openness to stand up for minority points of view on questions of fundamental rights, and that the civil rights movement spilled over to affect other movements. Activists continued to respond to that signal decades after Brown, even when that signal of judicial responsiveness and openness did not reflect the real prospects for achieving influence through a litigation-based strategy. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070077","81-93","David S.

I argue that Mark Twain&#39;s novel AConnecticutYankeeinKingArthur&#39;sCourt is a useful aid for reflection regarding this question. What Twain accomplishes, thanks in great part to his humor, is an honest exposure of the partial truths and considerable falsehoods contained in each common opinion regarding benevolent intervention. To highlight the complexity of Twain&#39;s thoughts on nation building, I discuss three possible interpretations of ConnecticutYankee. The first conceives of Hank Morgan as a well-intentioned democratic reformer, laying the proper foundation for a peaceful democratic transition after King Arthur dies. The second reads the book as ironically criticizing Hank for his overzealous promotion of democracy amidst a traditional culture. The third portrays Hank as an all-out revolutionary, justified in using any means to rid Camelot of slavery and oppression. Each of these interpretations represents, I believe, one aspect of Twain&#39;s outlook on the world. Brought together in the minds of thoughtful readers, these three themes prompt deeper reflection on the moral status of benevolent imperialism. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070053","49-61","Joel A.

While constructivism is a major theoretical orientation in international relations, large-n quantitative studies of the approach are uncommon in large measure due to the principal argument of constructivists: that interests should be treated endogenously. If interests and identities are mutually constituted, then it would seem to be impossible to distinguish their effects, creating a problem of observational equivalence. Some constructivist theorists nevertheless suggest that under certain conditions material interests can be thought of as causes of collective identity, meaning that it is in principle possible to isolate the influence of identity. We build on this &#8220;bounded&#8221; version of constructivism by identifying an arena of international relations in which the observable effect of the identities constituted by interactions among states can be analyzed independent of those states&#39; national security concerns. We study whether collective identities constituted by the international system during the Cold War systematically influenced judge bias in Olympic figure skating, examining whether judges&#39; evaluations of skaters systematically vary according to whether their respective states viewed one another as &#8220;friends,&#8221; &#8220;rivals,&#8221; or &#8220;enemies.&#8221; <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <a href='#fnb'><sup>b</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270707003X","17-29","and James F.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 197p. $75.00 cloth, $24.99 paper.By the early 1990s, scholars and policymakers alike began voicing reservations about the ability of deterrence strategies to counter nuclear, chemical and biological arsenals as these weapons proliferated into the hands of state and nonstate actors. Some observers doubted if it was technically feasible to create credible deterrent commitments given the possibility that there might be no significant targets in the opposing camp to hold at risk, that potential opponents were irrational or suicidal, or that it might be impossible to identify the culprits who launched the attack itself (e.g., the origins of an epidemic might never be identified). Others doubted the strategic wisdom of relying on deterrence, given that the costs of policy failure were potentially catastrophic. And, as the September 11 terrorist attacks demonstrated, overwhelming military superiority cannot deter or defend against terrorist cells that are willing to sacrifice themselves to achieve their objectives. Because of the inherent limitations of deterrence, many suggested that preventive war and preemption were the best way to deal with rogue states and terrorist organizations that were acquiring weapons of mass destruction.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071447","418-419","James J.

By Randall L. Schweller. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006. 200p. $29.95.In this insightful and elegantly written book, Randall Schweller examines the phenomenon of underbalancing, which he defines as situations in which &#8220;threatened countries have failed to recognize a clear and present danger, or, more typically, have simply not reacted to it or, more typically still, have responded in paltry and imprudent ways&#8221; (p. 1). The study is motivated by the failure of many states throughout history to act in accordance with the cardinal prediction of structural realist theory that states will tend to balance against rising powers that threaten their survival, through the acquisition of arms and/or allies. Schweller argues that domestic political factors account for this discrepancy, enhancing or diminishing the ability and/or willingness of states to mobilize their national resources in response to systemic dangers.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071435","417-418","Evan Resnick","Yeshiva University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","828","196"

By Saskia Sassen. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006. 502p. $35.00.The globalization literature has now reached a level of maturity that allows one to distinguish between different schools of thought. Whereas the first two stages broadly dealt with the process at large (its development and manifestation), the latest generation of scholarship seems mostly concerned with its current and future governance. Saskia Sassen's latest contribution to this dialogue is similar to Andrew Drainville's recent volume (ContestingGlobalization, 2004) for which she wrote the introduction. Both defend the need to situate the globalization discourse in concrete locations to gain a fuller understanding of it. More specifically, in Territory,Authority,Rights:FromMedievaltoGlobalAssemblages, Sassen presents an extensively developed criticism of the globalization literature. Sassen argues that both critics and proponents of the globalization concept in its latest iteration miss crucial developments of the transformative processes captured by the term &#8220;globalization&#8221; in their focus on established actors and institutional forms. She argues for the need to situate globalization more concretely and broadly, in terms of both space and place (i.e., territory), and for the establishment of new organizing logics, which manifest themselves in new combinations of authority and rights. Even though Sassen builds on her previous scholarship, this is a novel work&#8212;and a most welcome and important contribution to this field, as she not only points out the shortcomings of existing approaches, but provides a well-theorized proposition on how to remedy them.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071423","416-417","Joachim K.

Sidney Tarrow takes a more subtle approach by reminding us how exceedingly difficult it is to create and maintain transnational coalitions for social change in the first place.

By Harold James. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006. 166p. $24.95.This book has a clear argument. History shows that globalization needs a system of international and domestic rules for advancing trade, making possible cross-national exchanges of labor and capital, promoting economic growth, and achieving peace. The latest stage of globalization, from the end of the Cold War until September 11, is not an exception. Indeed the 1990s were a decade of intense discussion on new international rules and institutions (epitomized by the creation of the World Trade Organization). At the same time, the promotion and implementation of an international regulatory system will inevitably breed discontent and tensions in different areas of the global system. Some countries, groups, or individuals perceive the new regulatory system as imposing on them patterns of behavior and distributive relations proper of or advantageous to dominant countries, groups, and individuals. This generates a reaction against the globalizing process (and the regulatory systems that justify and support it). Each phase of the globalization process has ended in conflict, either in the form of an interstate rivalry that degenerated into war, or in the form of an asymmetrical conflict degenerating into terrorism (with the assassination of individuals representing universal symbols, such as New Yorkers in 2001 or the Austrian Empress &#8220;Sissi&#8221; one century earlier in 1894).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071368","408-409","Sergio Fabbrini","Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Trento","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","595","67"

One of his first conclusions is that the settler counties of North America, the Cone of South America, and Australasia are far wealthier than the others. He goes on to examine the varying effects of different colonial powers, such as Portugal, Spain, France, or Britain, and whether the end of colonialism came in the nineteenth century or more recently.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071241","392-393","David Howard Davis","University of Toledo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","622","93"

By Ruud Koopmans, Paul Statham, Marco Giugni, and Florence Passy. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005. 376p. $75.00 cloth, $25.00 paper.This is a well-written, rigorous, empirical contribution to scholarship on immigration and ethnic relations in post&#8211;World War II Europe. The study adds particular value through its grounded evaluation of basic assumptions concerning multiculturalism. Ruud Koopmans and colleagues coded political claims of migrant, extreme-right, and pro-migrant/anti-racist actors in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as reported in a prominent newspaper in each country. These data inform the authors' assessment of whether migrant group makeup, national conceptions of citizenship, or supranational institutions drive the various actors' political behavior. The authors conclude that different national citizenship models best explain variations in political claims making. Postwar migration to Western Europe generates intense political conflict, according to the authors, because it raises questions about basic aspects of national sovereignty, including border control, citizenship attribution, and the principles of nationhood.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270707123X","390-392","Nedim &Ouml;gelman","University of Texas, Austin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1418","344"

This is ironic because by the end of the twenthieth century, most Mexicans were optimistic about the possibility that competitive, fair elections would settle questions of authority and law and that political parties would aggregate the interests of the electorate. However, half a decade later, disputes over federal elections generated mass demonstrations from primary to final balloting, urban protests repeatedly paralyzed downtown Mexico City, an ongoing war between drug cartels left thousands dead in the north and west of the country, riots in the village of Atenco near the capital turned deadly, human rights accusations marred police and military, and by the dawn of the new Calderon administration at the end of 2006, intractable plantones (occupations) and paramilitary violence were bringing federal troops into the sleepy colonial city of Oaxaca.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071216","388-389","Heather Williams","Pomona College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","646","99"

By Vivek Chibber. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003. 334p. $49.50 cloth, $22.95 paper.Despite the newfound optimism about the turnaround in the Indian economy, this book's arguments about the failure of the postcolonial state to build a developmental state in the 1950s and 1960s are original, important, and relevant. Vivek Chibber's LockedinPlace sets out to dispel important misconceptions about India's early state-building effort. His arguments are both theoretically innovative and empirically novel. Theoretically, he aims to bring back class in our understanding of comparative political economy and to insert India into conversations about the developmental state that have focused only on East Asia. He also aims to give us some sense of the &#8220;mechanisms that generate contrasting reactions&#8221; (p. 226) in the two cases that he studies: India and South Korea. This is a welcome modification to the state-centric debates about India's past failure where the state is the only target of attack or of pious hope. Empirically, the author uncovers some new archival material to argue that Indian business &#8220;defeated&#8221; the state's efforts to build a developmental state in the 1940s. The new evidence shows powerfully that Indian business had much greater power to shape economic policy in the 1940s and 1950s than we knew.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071186","384-385","Aseema Sinha","University of Wisconsin-Madison","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","804","154"

By Joseph F. Zimmerman. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2006. 288p. $70.00 cloth, $24.95 paper.The adoption by Congress of major statutes regulating the environment, workplace, and consumer transactions, beginning in the mid-1960s, has been seen by critics as granting too much authority to the federal government at the expense of the states. The critique of federal social regulation initiatives questions not only whether such policy interventions can be justified per se, but as importantly, whether congressional preemption itself is appropriate. Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan sought specific legislative and policy changes aimed at shifting formal authority away from Congress and back to the states&#8212;a &#8220;new federalism&#8221; to reverse the expansion of federal authority. At least rhetorically (though not necessarily substantively), President George W. Bush has taken a similar stance. But the perceived need to check federal authority is not the sole purview of conservatives; President Jimmy Carter supported a significant program of economic deregulation, and President Bill Clinton oversaw initiatives to devolve federal authority as part of a broader reform of federal public management practices.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071149","378-379","Brian J.

In subsequent polls, nearly two-thirds of the public opposed President George W. Bush's postelection proposal for a &#8220;surge&#8221; in the U.S. troop presence in Iraq.

By Mark R. Nemec. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2006. 312p. $70.00 cloth, $24.95 paper.The end of the Civil War ushered a new era in American state-building as the government sought to reshape the structure and identity of politics, group formation, and individual identity. During this period, nongovernmental agencies became central to disseminating and legitimating state authority. Although universities have been recognized as influential agencies, Mark R. Nemec argues that prior works overlooked the process by which they gained this influence. In IvoryTowersandNationalistMinds, Nemec illuminates the rise of American universities as active partners and independent agents of state building from 1862 to 1920. Universities provided services to national development through promoting democratic ideals, industrial competitiveness, and intellectual vanguardism. Primarily through the &#8220;institutional entrepreneurship&#8221; of university presidents, American universities rapidly expanded their role and influence in society.

By imposing on states a set of standards, benchmarks of yearly progress, and imposing sanctions on failing schools, the U.S. Department of Education has made a significant step from being more than a federal bully pulpit and a perch for fading politicians to a genuine ministry of education. This is ironic because the U.S. Constitution reserves to the states educational policy, except when it comes to enforcing civil rights.

Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2005. 298p. $26.95 cloth.Immigration is a powerful narrative in the history of the United States, at times evoking optimism and at other times providing fodder to foment xenophobia. These two books, authored by a pair of New York City&#8211;based scholars, share a common vantage point in the experience of the most racially and ethnically diverse city of immigrants in the United States. At the same time, the books are a study in contrasts, a neat fit to both ends of the spectrum between hope and fear. One is concerned with enhancing freedom and the other with maintaining order.

They seem to bridge&#8212;or at least to begin to build a bridge between&#8212;on the one hand, the lofty aspirations of democrats who invoke a language of government &#8220;by the people,&#8221; and on the other, the reality of modern democracies in which elites govern, while citizens judge their performances.

Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006. 316p. $49.95 cloth, $21.95 paper.The notion that immigrants need institutions of support as they try to make it in the U.S. economy is certainly nothing new. At the turn of the century, Jane Addams and the Settlement House Movement, beginning in Chicago with Hull House, made it their mission to provide the types of support that would ease immigrants' transition into American life. Janice Fine's WorkerCenters is essentially a primer for activists on the role of worker centers as institutions designed to provide support to low-wage workers, especially immigrant workers in metropolitan areas. Defining worker centers as community-based mediating institutions that provide support to low-wage workers, Fine considers the effectiveness of these centers in improving the lives of low-wage workers. She also raises an even larger question: Just what institutional mechanisms are necessary for integrating low-wage immigrants into American civil society so that they can derive the benefits of ongoing economic representation and political action?<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071022","365-366","Oren M.

In this book, Baker sets out to provide an empirical examination of three aspects of America's perceived crisis of values. The first of these is the trend hypothesis: In recent decades, America has experienced a significant decline in its commitment to traditional moral values. The second is the comparison hypothesis: Moral values in the United States have declined relative to most other nations.

She takes as one &#8220;main point of reference&#8221; (p. 9) for her argument, Bernard Manin's claim in ThePrinciplesofRepresentativeGovernment (1997) that the practice of contemporary democracy is still constrained by the fact that &#8220;there has been no significant change in the institutions regulating the selection of representatives and the influence of the popular will on their decisions in office&#8221; (p. 229, n. 2). For many, this view of unchanged institutions simply reflects either the more defensive observation that modern governments continue to need Schumpeterian neutralizing restrictions on participation or, conversely, the critical claim that modern democracy continues to fall short of an ideal (or perhaps idealized) Athenian standard of direct self-rule. On both of these views, Urbinati notes, representative democracy is seen as an oxymoron (p. 4). However, she quite forcefully disagrees, and what is more, she believes both the times and contemporary democratic theorizing are on her side.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270707096X","360-361","Shannon Stimson","University of California at Berkeley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1358","321"

Almost all of them are unmistakably conservative, indeed, sometimes reactionary; typically hawkish and empire-minded in foreign affairs; and generally disposed to discipline the waywardness of the masses. I must emphasize that the obstacle I have in mind is not posed by Straussians who work in political theory; from them, non-Straussians will often learn or at least gain the benefits of a bracing encounter. The talent of Strauss is not polemical, despite his numerous comments on his times. We non-Straussians should minimize these comments so that we may separate Strauss from his sympathizers who figure in public life, whether in office or behind the scenes or in the public press. To be sure, thinkers bear some responsibility for what their devoted activist admirers make of them. But Strauss is vastly more than his topicality; and his value will survive the accidents of politics that have permitted a few to write about public affairs and act in public life under his direct or indirect tutelage.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070946","355-359","George Kateb","Princeton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1149","177"

In so doing, Gilchrist staunchly defends the notion of a liberal consensus in American political life. However, this is not merely a restatement of Louis Hartz's rightly famous theory. Instead, we are offered a nuanced and thoughtful analysis of how American culture delineates a &#8220;matrix&#8221; that reflects the interaction of myth, religion, and ideology. The author goes to great lengths to demarcate the differences and connections among these rich and powerful concepts. In the process, he does an admirable job articulating a fundamental liberalism that is at work in America. Thus, he offers a powerful development of the Hartz thesis and takes on those critics who see that theory as fraught with failings. Indeed, Rogers Smith's CivicIdeals (1997) and CultusAmericanus provide the materials for a high-minded debate about how American politics was shaped in the past and how our history continues to shape the present.

However, tolerance, as T. M. Scanlon argues (TheDifficultyofTolerance, 2003), is never easy. At the very least, it means acknowledging that other people whom I dislike are entitled to the same legal protections as I am and should be equally free to decide how to live their lives. Asking me to avert my eyes or look away from those beliefs and ways of life that I find repugnant may mean that tolerance comes close to being an &#8220;impossible virtue&#8221; (Bernard Williams, &#8220;Toleration: An Impossible Virtue?&#8221; in David Heyd, ed., Toleration:AnElusiveVirtue, 1996), but the alternative&#8212;intolerance&#8212;seems a nonstarter.

By W. James Booth. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006. 264p. $42.50.W. James Booth has written a profound book about memory in relation to identity and justice in politics. On the one hand, he analyzes the central place of memory in the constitution of identity: A sense of continuity over time, the basis and sign of personal or collective identity, depends on memory. On the other hand, he explores the central place of memory in doing justice: Justice requires &#8220;a subject of attribution&#8221; who can take responsibility or be held accountable for conduct over time, who also can remember injury and demand redress. But investment in the past and memory of injustice, Booth shows, also run against the grain of core elements in democratic life. Partly, emphasis on the constitutive weight of the past seems in tension with democratic norms deriving identity from will or consent, not inheritance or descent. Partly, any &#8220;thick&#8221; collective identity, forged by a particularizing past, seems in tension with democratic aspirations to universality, and with the globalizing reality of pluralized and hybridized attachment. Moreover, efforts to redress past injustices seem impossible to separate from resentment, binding people to the past and its wounds. Booth's book is important, then, because it eloquently explores the necessity and value&#8212;but also the costs and dangers&#8212;of memory and identity in politics, especially around the issue of justice.

By Leora Batnitzky. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 304p. $80.00.In recent years, Leo Strauss has achieved a posthumous successdescandal as the (purported) philosophical architect of neoconservatism. Strauss's works have been scrutinized by detractors and partisans to determine whether he bears responsibility for the Bush administration's foreign policy. Amidst the clamor, however, more measured assessments are starting to emerge. Today, the most provocative appraisals of his work come from scholars in Jewish studies, as Leora Batnitzky's fascinating book attests. In LeoStraussandEmmanuelLevinas, Batnitzky seeks to establish Strauss's contribution to modern Jewish thought, but her argument for his importance as a Jewish thinker also reframes the vexed question of his legacy for American politics. She offers a nonpolemical, non-Straussian defense of Leo Strauss. In many ways, her portrait of Strauss as a philosophical skeptic and political moderate resonates with that of Steven B. Smith, in ReadingLeoStrauss:Politics,Philosophy,Judaism (2006). However, Batnitzky departs from Smith (and, indeed, from most readers of Strauss) when she hails Strauss as the most ardent philosophical defender of Jewish revelation in the modern period.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707070831","341-342","Julie E.

Despite this, &#8220;you should be able to identify a coherent configuration of organization, space, and interaction&#8221; (p. 10). Several of the social formations studied by the authors in this volume are only partly digital: that is, they combine digital and nondigital elements. They are all, however, subject to &#8220;digitization,&#8221; which involves the &#8220;rendering of facets of social and political life in a digital form&#8221; (p. 16). One important reason for studying digital formations is that some are potentially &#8220;destabilizing of existing hierarchies of scale and nested hierarchies&#8221; (p. 19), while others reinforce them. An example of the former is the open-source software movement (as chronicled here by Steve Weber); an example of the latter is what Dieter Ernst in his chapter calls the &#8220;global flagship networks&#8221; created by large multinational corporations.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072118","675-676","Jeffrey A.

Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2006. 186p. $89.95 cloth.In his book, Matthew Crosston lays out an interesting and worthwhile argument: that by focusing on short-term security assistance and long-term democracy building in authoritarian regimes, the United States is unwittingly creating conditions for extremism and anti-American sentiments throughout the world. His case study is the region of Central Asia&#8212;one that had largely been ignored by policymakers until the need for non-OPEC energy that increased in the 1990s and the military actions in Afghanistan that began in October 2001. According to Crosston, given the newfound strategic importance of Central Asia in its &#8220;global war on terrorism,&#8221; the U.S. government has all but abandoned the notion of advocating democracy in the region. He emphatically states, &#8220;There has been no real oversight to gauge whether vibrant democracies are being established [in Central Asia]. And there has certainly not been a process where regimes have been singled out and denounced for the fact that they have consistently denied their citizens the right to chose their leaders and engage their governments in peaceful opposition and open debate&#8221; (p. 18). This particular theme runs throughout the book under the moniker &#8220;Wonka Vision of Democracy&#8221;&#8212;a reference to the children's tale of CharlieandtheChocolateFactory&#8212;which suggests that U.S. policymakers ignore the &#8220;reality of democracy&#8221; while professing &#8220;admiration for the fantasy democracy supposedly emerging.&#8221; Crosston quotes excerpts from various public statements of U.S. government officials in a variety of settings to show that this is a &#8220;bipartisan effort&#8221; to avoid the difficult challenges raised by providing assistance to authoritarian regimes.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270707209X","672-674","Roger D.

Rather than focus on rare events such as war, this research program seeks to understand the dynamics at work for what many scholars perceive to be the most dangerous pairs of interstate enemies in the system. Those enemies are historical rivals, typically coded as strategic or enduring rivals. In a rivalry, hatred is endemic and cooperation may be rare. These actors clearly are of a different sort than the rest of the system and need to be studied in their historical context.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072088","671-672","Brandon Valeriano","University of Illinois at Chicago","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","813","87"

Mainstream scholars might find it all too easy to dismiss when confronted immediately with its refusal to define feminist methodologies and its jabs at quantitative methodologists for presumably assuming their work to be value neutral. Such a dismissal, however, would be a grave mistake. For the book presents a collage of perspectives on feminist methodology. The essays address the questions feminists ask, why they ask such questions, what we learn from these approaches, and how this research contributes to our knowledge. This is not a &#8220;how to&#8221; book, as you do need to reach your own conclusions&#8212;to find your own way methodologically. But this apparent lack of direction is more of an invitation to experiment and to add to our knowledge.

Straus argues that while this is not wrong, it does not go far enough to explain why genocide happened and why so many Hutus were mobilized to kill their Tutsi neighbors as well as moderate Hutus. Emphasizing the need to link the national, elite level on which most study has focused with the local level in the rural areas where most killing was done, Straus undertook a unique study, interviewing more than two hundred confessed and convicted male perpetrators in Rwanda's jails.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072064","669-670","Martin Shaw","University of Sussex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1333","348"

McMann's work is a welcome addition to the burgeoning literature on democracy and democratization with the discussion of a new form of government, namely the hybridregime. McMann uses a multidimensional approach to understand a complex and conceptually messy issue: democratic participation. Like other scholars, she uses this hybrid regime framework, which has been described as containing both democratic and authoritarian elements (e.g., see Larry J. Diamond, &#8220;Thinking about Hybrid Regimes,&#8221; JournalofDemocracy 13 [April 2002]: 21&#8211;35). Her work is a significant contribution to the understanding of how formerly transitional governments currently operate in relation to citizens and citizen political participation. Utilizing the hybrid regime concept illustrates the true nature of such regimes to the same degree that the terms &#8220;electoral,&#8221; &#8220;minimal,&#8221; &#8220;illiberal&#8221; democracies and &#8220;transitional&#8221; regimes obfuscate it.

Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2006. 228p. $55.00 cloth, $21.95 paper.There were relatively few states when the modern discipline of political science came into being, and the most thoroughly institutionalized among them became intellectual as well as normative templates for what states should be. Our initial expectations for the political development of the vast number of new states&#8212;an increase from fewer than 60 to more than 200 since the end of World War II&#8212;had been conditioned by ahistorical takes on the roles of the social and the cultural in state formation and nation building (see Gabriel A. Almond and James S. Coleman, eds., ThePoliticsoftheDevelopingAreas, 1960; and not excepting the contributions of Charles Tilly and associates in TheFormationofNationalStatesinWesternEurope, 1975). Two such expectations were that, over time, states' populations would exhibit more coherent political cultures and increasing social order (with diminishing violence) within frameworks of state-delineated laws and state-centered institutions. The authors of these two books suggest that those expectations are more likely to be met in form and illusion than in substance. For Thomas Hobbes, stateness is hardly sufficient for social cohesion or nonviolent civil existence. They also give reason to ask how well they have been met in the model states of the historic West.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072027","663-665","Martin O.

Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 2006. 286p. $27.95.Rarely have I enjoyed (and learned from) reading a book as much as this one, whose parts are quite brilliant on occasion but whose overall argument falls well short of its claim and aim. Patrick Thaddeus Jackson argues with verve and conviction that the Federal Republic of Germany's creation and its subsequent joining in alliances with the United States and its European partners would not have occurred without the invention, the implementation, and deployment of &#8220;the West&#8221; as a unifying concept of political, cultural, and social identity. Challenging the explanatory powers of realist theories, as well as their international relations constructivist, Marxist, and liberal counterparts, Jackson develops something he calls a &#8220;transactionalsocialconstructionist conception of social reality: transactional because the analytic focus is on social ties and transactions rather than putatively solid and stable actors with relatively fixed interests, and socialconstructionist because the causal mechanisms producing policy outcomes involve the social production and reproduction of patterns of meaning&#8221; (p. 15, italics in original). This self-labeled &#8220;post-structural approach&#8221; (ibid., again italics in original) allows Jackson to navigate a fine line between the Scylla of contingency and the Charibdis of determinism even though he comes closer to the &#8220;agency&#8221; side of the ubiquitous agency&#8212;structure tension that will remain forever unresolved.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072015","662-663","Andrei S.

If globalization does matter, does it constrain or facilitate the creation and expansion of social programs? If globalization has a positive effect on welfare states, which conditions prevent or enable increases in social spending and broadening of coverage? These questions are the focus of Miguel Glatzer and Dietrich Rueschemeyer's edited volume. These editors, who coauthored the introduction and conclusion, carefully selected studies by a group of scholars who are all both experts in the study of welfare states and masters of a specific geographic region or country. The studies include Western Europe (by John D. Stephens), Eastern Europe (Mitchell A. Orenstein and Martine R. Haas), Southern Europe (Miguel Glatzer), Latin America (Evelyne Huber), Russia (Linda J. Cook), and South Korea (Ho Keun Song and Kyung Zoon Hong). In addition to these regional or country case studies, there is a variable-oriented chapter by Geoffrey Garrett and David Nickerson that explores correlations between globalization and social spending across a large number of countries. Since they provided the authors with a limited common framework, giving them sufficient room to explore their own ideas, the editors achieved a good balance between coherence and diversity.

A short introduction and conclusion establish a theory that draws on Carl Schmitt to link Mao's question &#8220;Who are our enemies and who are our friends?&#8221; to the extraordinary police technologies that united the latter and defeated the former. The first four of five substantive chapters deal with policing politics during the Jiangxi Soviet era, the Yan'an era, the 1950s, and the Cultural Revolution. The last substantive chapter depicts the reform era's transition from politics to economics. The book sheds light on the origins of and prospects for contemporary Chinese politics, but also provides subtle tools for understanding what was more crudely labeled &#8220;totalitarianism.&#8221; Michael Dutton demonstrates that studying police technologies can yield important insight into politics in general.

Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2005. 257p. $39.95.Over the last 20 years, Japan has passed from wunderkind of global capitalism to problem child, troubled by recession and stagnation. Marie Anchordoguy's ReprogrammingJapan joins the growing body of analysis diagnosing this sad falling off, focusing on the crisis of the high-technology sectors where silicon samurai once seemed to reign supreme. In Anchordoguy's view, the cause of the problem is &#8220;communitarian capitalism.&#8221; This is a capitalism that depends heavily on state direction&#8212;governmental support for select large firms, a social contract assuring citizens permanent employment, regular wage increases, and union&#8211;management deals for labor peace. This, she suggests, is something verging on socialism. Although it has &#8220;all the trappings of private property and profit-making institutions,&#8221; the dynamism of the market is constrained by a system that &#8220;favor[s] social stability over efficiency&#8221; (p. 7). It is, in her view, &#8220;quasi-capitalism&#8221; (p. 7). Communitarian capitalism, she argues, laid the basis for Japanese success from the 1950s through the 1970s, when global economic conditions were positive, technological trajectories were clear, and foreign products could be reverse-engineered. But in the 1980s and 1990s, intensified competition, transnational outsourcing, and fiercely enforced intellectual property rights made this system a fetter on the very forces of production it had fostered.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071927","649-650","Nick Dyer-Witheford","University of Western Ontario","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","855","85"

Columbus: The Ohio State University Press, 2006. 209p. $49.95.AUnifiedTheoryofPartyCompetition &#8220;integrates the perspectives of spatial modeling and behavioral research&#8221; (p. xvii). It does so by expanding the usual set of assumptions that underlie spatial models, and by accounting for various aspects of voters' electoral behavior. Choices of campaign strategies by party elites, their decisions of what to propose to the voters, are directed toward the same objective as in the tradition growing from Anthony Downs's (1957) AnEconomicTheoryofDemocracy&#8212;maximization of the vote that they receive in an election. When pursuing this goal, however, parties confront a richer environment of voters' preferences than spatial theorists customarily assume. James Adams, Samuel Merill, and Bernard Grofman take the Downsian criterion&#8212;policy distances between the voter and a party&#8212;as but one weighted component in the electors' utility functions. Other factors that compel a voter to support a particular party and which the authors include in order to incorporate &#8220;the full diversity of measured influences on the vote&#8221; (p. 228) are &#8220;partisanship, retrospective economic evaluations, and sociodemographic characteristics&#8221; (p. 228). Anticipating that the voters will choose with more than just the policy distances in mind, parties find themselves diverging in policy space as they compete for the vote. Thus, a more realistic set of behavioral assumptions with regard to the voters leads to more reasonable predictions for the location of party platforms than the convergence result characteristic of most spatial models. This furthers the authors' objective to improve the quality of the contribution of the spatial modeling literature to our understanding of the rationale behind the ways in which party systems are arranged in the world's democracies.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071915","648-649","Olga Shvetsova","Binghamton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","675","141"

By Noah Pickus. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005. 272p. $35.00 cloth, $22.95 paper.Is civic nationalism an oxymoron? Noah Pickus does not think so, at least not in America. Here, the best leaders have been able to combine a &#8220;rational commitment to a common creed based on abstract ideals&#8221; with a moderate nationalism valuing &#8220;tradition, inherited opinion, and a set of obligations that flow from sharing a distinctive history and culture&#8221; (p. 5). Civic nationalism, he argues, is possible in theory and has been achieved in practice. At pivotal moments in American history, leaders like James Madison and Theodore Roosevelt found a way for &#8220;civic principles and American nationalism&#8221; to reinforce each other (p. 5). Pickus calls for a new emphasis on civic nationalism in our time and cautions against too quickly dividing &#8220;civic nationalist positions into civic or national positions alone&#8221; (p. 125). In this carefully argued if not always persuasive book, he counsels a prudent policy of balancing &#8220;the universal thrust of civic principles&#8221; with &#8220;the particularist bond of nationalist sentiment&#8221; (p. 62). He bravely challenges a new generation of civic nationalists to fight for that balance today.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071903","646-647","James Simeone","Illinois Wesleyan University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","830","79"

And, for practical purposes, prediction is critical, as it gives us important insight into the potential outcomes that might ensue, given certain conditions. However, research on information processing is increasingly focusing our attention more explicitly on understanding the process by which voters make decisions rather than focusing exclusively on the decisions themselves. This is exactly what Richard Lau and David Redlawsk do in HowVotersDecide.

Moreover, researchers tackling this important question systematically reach dissimilar conclusions. No one doubts that business influences public policy. At issue is the extent of its influence relative to other actors. In the tradition of Charles Lindblom's classic PoliticsandMarkets (1977), some recent scholarship has found that business holds a privileged position in policy debates because of its unparalleled resources and centrality to the nation's economic prosperity (e.g., see Kay Schlozman and John Tierney, OrganizedInterestsandAmericanDemocracy, 1986; David Vogel, KindredStrangers, 1996; Richard Lehne, GovernmentandBusiness, 2001). Others tread more in the tradition of Raymond Bauer, Lewis Dexter, and Ithiel de Sola Pool's 1963 classic, AmericanBusinessandPublicPolicy, finding that business is constrained and increasingly on the defensive amid an explosion of politically and media-savvy interest groups (e.g., see Mark Smith, AmericanBusinessandPoliticalPower, 2002; Jeffrey Berry, InterestGroupLiberalism, 1999; Frank Baumgartner and Beth Leach, BasicInterests, 1998).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270707185X","640-641","Robert F.

In doing so, he makes an important contribution to the literature on race and voting behavior. Contrary to previous work that claims that white vote choice in elections featuring black candidates is a function of white prejudice or backlash, Hajnal proffers a more nuanced information model of vote choice. When white voters first face the prospect of black elected leadership, they resist and organize against black candidates because of racial stereotypes, fears that the quality of life in the city will deteriorate, and fears that black elected leaders will initiate policy changes that will benefit blacks at the expense of whites. However, when these fears do not materialize, whites sharply lower their resistance and even begin to support black candidates in greater numbers.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071800","632-633","Andra Gillespie","Emory University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","762","114"

Lawrence D. Bobo and Mia Tuan offer possibly the most comprehensive exposition and explanation of that argument in their new book, PrejudiceinPolitics. First, Bobo and Tuan let us know exactly what group position theory is and how to make sense of it in comparison to other ideas about the nature of prejudice in politics. Along with group position, they examine the relevance of other theoretical explanations of prejudice, such as self-interest, clashing values, and symbolic racism. Then they use a unique survey to operationalize, compare, and contrast these competing ideas about prejudice in politics. In the end, they offer us the compelling idea that the &#8220;real&#8221; answer to understanding prejudice in politics lies not in eliminating alternative hypotheses but in a group position&#8211;oriented synthesis of these presumably competing ideas.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071769","625-626","Harwood K.

Notwithstanding the fact that modern liberalism fought its way into historical existence as a radical alternative to political excesses sanctioned by traditional versions of natural law theory, Wolfe maintains that the political character of this initial confrontation has given rise to unnecessarily narrow and antagonistic understandings of the relationship between them. Natural law and modern liberalism are in fact products of two richly varied and complex intellectual traditions. By disentangling the essential features of natural law theory from the historical circumstances within which it developed, and by setting out the full array of political philosophies that constitute the tradition of liberalism, Wolfe advances a serious and thoughtful account of the way in which the objective moral principles of natural law can and ought to be reconciled with modern liberalism's distinctive commitments to liberty and equality. By challenging the underlying premises of contemporary debate about the proper relationship between religion and politics, he opens a new and constructive path for future dialogue among often polarized and combative participants.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071745","622-623","Aristide Tessitore","Furman University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","773","173"

In his superb book, Mark Stein follows this path, but with the specific purpose of pitting utilitarianism against egalitarianism. It is when these competing theories deal with disability, he argues, that we notice how much they diverge, and more to the point, how and why it is that utilitarianism is superior.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071733","621-622","Jerome E.

The result has surely been a more accurate account of cognition, persuasion, and group dynamics. Political science has been a bit slower to awaken. Happily, with Aristotle for inspiration, we have more new work to digest. In this book, Marlene Sokolon continues to reflect on just what Aristotle has to contribute. Several books have already worked this area, and so Sokolon ends up reiterating parts of this literature, but the book serves as an excellent resource for surveying the politically relevant emotions discussed in the Rhetoric and for encouraging conversation between current empirical political science and political theory.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071721","620-621","Barbara Koziak","St. John's University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1020","136"

By Steven Slaughter. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005. 272p. $75.00.Mainstream accounts define globalization as two connected processes. The first is the relentless increase in the interrelation of economic actors. The second is growing recognition of the superiority of &#8220;market forces&#8221; over state intervention in the economy. Free markets are seen as &#8220;natural&#8221; forces or &#8220;iron laws&#8221; of economics that only the economically illiterate or perhaps the insane would limit. Among the many impressive contributions made by Steven Slaughter is the distinction between what he calls &#8220;globalization&#8221; and &#8220;economic globalization.&#8221; The former, he argues, is the growing interdependence of economic actors that appears to be an inherent aspect of capitalist development. The latter, however, denotes the contingent victory of free market ideology, or &#8220;neoliberalism&#8221; over other forms of liberalism. For Slaughter, economic globalization is not the inevitable victory of &#8220;natural&#8221; and efficient markets against the state. Economic globalization is a form of &#8220;governance&#8221; that involves state policy, relations between states, and norms and everyday practices. This governance was the creation of state policy and international agreements. Slaughter's argument constitutes an updating of Karl Polanyi's famous claim in TheGreatTransformation (2001) that nineteenth-century &#8220;lasissez-faire&#8221; economics was an invention.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270707171X","618-620","Jacob Segal","Kingsborough Community College of the City University of New York","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","992","177"

New York: Routledge, 2006. 200p. $110.00.Social choice theory examines group decision making from axiomatic and mathematical perspectives. It often produces results that have troubling implications for democracy. Consider Kenneth Arrow's general possibility theorem (see SocialChoiceandIndividualValues, [1951] 1963). It shows that no social welfare function can simultaneously satisfy several apparently reasonable postulates involving rationality and ethical norms. When this theorem is applied to the study of politics, it challenges the legitimacy of all collective decision-making procedures. No voting system can guarantee rational social preference orderings through ethical means when there are more than two voters and more than two alternatives in the choice set. Majority rule, for example, has been subject to criticism because it cannot ensure rational outcomes. Rationality, in this case, is defined in terms of transitivity. When majority rule fails to produce transitive collective preference orderings&#8212;a condition that is commonly called cycling&#8212;the outcomes may be interpreted as arbitrary or incoherent.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071691","615-617","Johnny Goldfinger","Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1225","187"

Keys makes significant contributions to our understanding of Aquinas, Aristotle, and theories of the common good. Keys makes two fundamental, persuasive arguments: 1) Aquinas's account of the will's natural inclination to virtue (and consequent sociability) and his development of a theory of natural law are deliberate philosophical attempts to correct weaknesses in Aristotle's account of the common good; and 2) in correcting and improving upon Aristotle, Aquinas &#8220;is consciously laying new, deeper, and broader foundations for ethics and political science&#8221; (p. 111), foundations which are&#8212;or should be&#8212;of considerable value to contemporary secular (as well as Christian) political thought. Specifically, she argues that Aquinas's new foundations address a persistent difficulty with traditional common good theory: &#8220;how to elaborate a &#8216;unitary but complex&#8217; account of the human good that does justice to the many worthwhile ways of life and the multiple genuine goods that people seek by nature and by choice&#8221; (p. 14).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071678","612-613","Todd Breyfogle","University of Denver","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","969","150"

New York: Routledge, 2005. 224p. $125.00.Two trends, each a generation in the making, have affected the recent study of poverty and inequality. In 1979, Amartya Sen asked &#8220;Equality of What?&#8221; in his Tanner Lecture at Stanford University. There, and in numerous articles and books since, Sen and his collaborators developed a rich account of poverty, inequality, and of human well-being more generally considered. This work, though its original basis was in the classical political economy of subsistence and human freedom, grew to be buttressed by a wide range of ethical, social, and other economic matters. In so doing, it encouraged the development of the second trend, the greater interweaving of developments in the different social sciences and in political and philosophical theory that might be brought to bear on the consideration of poverty and inequality. There has come to be a greater understanding by economists, sociologists, political theorists, and philosophers of what they might learn from one another.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071630","606-608","S.

In addition to Klein, these include St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Maritain, Wilfred Bion, D. W. Winnicott, John Milton (ParadiseLost) and Sophocles (Antigone). However, to an external other, often the salience of his objects or their congruence appears more a function of Alford's attachment to them than to their logical cogency. Furthermore, despite his attempts to reconcile their disparities, his simultaneous use of conflicting discourses of &#8220;natural&#8221; and &#8220;narrative&#8221; render the epistemological and ethical status of his &#8220;natural law&#8221; of reparation ambiguous.

Seeing the EU as undemocratic or insufficiently democratic, they devise institutional innovations to democratize it. These innovations seem to require breaking the traditional link between democracy and the nation-state, which in this context appears outmoded or inappropriate. This article challenges that approach, arguing that it gets the relationship between democracy and the sovereign state wrong&#8212;or at least, incomplete&#8212;by stressing modern democratic theory&#39;s empirical ties to the state while underestimating their normative significance. The complex interdependence of normative and empirical assumptions informing modern democratic theory means that detaching democracy from the state is much less straightforward than critics often imagine. The essay argues instead for conceiving the EU as a problem for democratic theory. Doing so reveals that democratic theory is ill-equipped to address recent changes in the configuration of rule and new structures of governance associated with Europeanization, European integration, and globalization more broadly.

Electoral Fraud, Collective Action Problems, and Post-Communist Colored Revolutions","In countries where citizens have strong grievances against the regime, attempts to address these grievances in the course of daily life are likely to entail high costs coupled with very low chances of success in any meaningful sense; consequently, most citizens will choose not to challenge the regime, thus reflecting the now well-known collective action problem. When a regime commits electoral fraud, however, an individual&#39;s calculus regarding whether to participate in a protest against the regime can be changed significantly. This argument yields important implications for how we interpret the wave of &#8220;colored revolutions&#8221; that swept through Serbia, Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan in the first half of this decade. Applying the collective action framework to the colored revolutions also yields a parsimonious contribution to the political science literature on social protest: electoral fraud can be a remarkably useful tool for solving the collective action problems faced by citizens in countries where governments are not, to use Barry Weingast&#39;s language, appropriately restrained by the populace. While modest, such an observation actually can speak to a wide-ranging number of questions in the literature, including why people choose to protest when they do, how protests at one place and time can affect the likelihood for future protests, and new aspects of the relationship between elections and protest. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071538","535-551","Joshua A.

At the heart of the problem is the difficulty of divining future intentions. Two arguments have dominated the debate. One focuses on power and likely Chinese revisionism. The other highlights China&#39;s growing interdependence and likely future satisfaction. Both are problematic in terms of logic and evidence. They offer linear projections that ignore the way that China&#39;s future is likely to be contingent&#8212;especially on the interaction of foreign policy ideas and events. Relative power and interdependence are important but their impact is mediated through the doctrines leaders use to justify action and establish authority: those ideas are prone to change in regular ways&#8212;and with them China&#39;s intentions.

Social constructivists, for instance, regularly examine frames, persuasion, and other discursive mechanisms by which actors reach intersubjective agreement. Critical theorists add an overtly normative dimension by embracing the transformative potential of public deliberation. In contrast, realists and neorealists claim that outcomes are determined by the distribution of material power&#8212;political communication and discursive ideals are virtually meaningless elements in international politics. Put simply, talk is cheap. Given this view, it is puzzling that many prominent realists participate actively in national foreign policy debates and in that context both implicitly and explicitly embrace views about political discourse that are remarkably consistent with those held by constructivists and critical theorists. In the recent Iraq debate, the realists reveal lies, political spin, and other distortions of the debate promulgated by government elites and their allies. They challenge the legitimacy of established policies and critique excessive secrecy. Most importantly, these neorealists seek to transform public and elite consciousness so as to produce social pressures for alternative outcomes. Realists have apparently rejected their own theoretical presuppositions about the meaning and role of political communication, which has important implications for both policy debate and IR theorizing. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071514","503-514","Rodger A.

Costly self-enforcement of socially optimal behavior has a number of independent links in political science, economics, psychology, sociology, computer science, and biology. This paper integrates the study of sanctions-based provision of public goods in the social sciences with the research on evolutionary adaptedness of altruistic punishment in the life sciences. Altruistic punishment appears to be (1) economically rational, (2) evolutionarily robust as an individual propensity and as a cultural norm, (3) normatively more appealing than tit-for-tat, which is a reciprocal punishment by defection, and (4) socially common. The theoretical and empirical importance of altruistic punishment has immediate policy implications. Examination of commons around the world suggests that privatization and centralized coercion are not the only solutions to the tragedy of the commons. A viable policy alternative is to facilitate the evolution of the commons as a common-property regime with its own norms and a certain degree of independence. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071502","489-501","Oleg Smirnov","Stony Brook University, E-mail: <a href=mailto:Oleg.Smirnov@sunysb.edu>Oleg.Smirnov@sunysb.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2102","330"

Bush, the Republican Party, and the &#8220;New&#8221; American Party System","Scholars have long expressed concern that the ascendance of the modern presidency since the New Deal and World War II, by hastening the decline of political parties and fostering the expansion of the administrative state, portended an era of chronically low public engagement and voter turnout and an increasingly fractious and impotent national politics. Presidents&#39; inattentiveness to the demands of party-building and grassroots mobilization, coupled with their willingness to govern through administration, were seen as key obstacles to the revitalization of a politics based in widespread political interest and collective responsibility for public policy. This article argues that George W. Bush&#39;s potent combination of party leadership and executive administration, foreshadowed by Ronald Reagan&#39;s earlier efforts, suggests the emergence of a new presidential leadership synthesis and a &#8220;new&#8221; party system. This new synthesis does not promise a return to pre-modern party politics; rather, it indicates a rearticulation of the relationship between the presidency and the party system. The erosion of old old-style partisan politics allowed for a more national and issue-based party system to develop, forging new links between presidents and parties. As the 2006 elections reveal, however, it remains to be seen whether such parties, which are inextricably linked to executive-centered politics and governance, can perform the critical function of moderating presidential ambition and mobilizing public support for party principles and policies. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071496","461-488","Sidney M.

Unfortunately, shared attention has not led to shared insights, as these scholars have remained isolated in their respective academies. Recently scholars have begun targeting this disciplinary barrier, and questioning whether developing norms of judicial supremacy have importantly raised the stakes of determining the legitimacy of courts setting policy in a democracy. This article proposes a new approach to the study of judicial review aimed at understanding systemic change rather than institutional legitimacy, using recent concerns over the drift from judicial review to judicial supremacy as a point of departure for study. I recommend, to both normative and positive scholars, a new and integrated focus on the relationship between judicial policymaking and wider transformations of the constitutional order that have previously been obscured by orienting constitutional scholarship around the counter-majoritarian difficulty. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071484","447-459","Allison M.

The Decline of the Short-Term Supreme Court Justice","Against the backdrop of a decade-long wait for a Supreme Court vacancy, legal academics from across the political spectrum have recently proposed or supported significant constitutional or statutory reforms designed to limit the terms of Supreme Court justices and increase the pace of turnover at the Court. Fearing a Court that is increasingly out of touch with the national mood and staffed by justices of advanced age, advocates of term and age limits contend that the trend in Supreme Court tenures is inexorably upward. But are Supreme Court justices really serving longer now than in the past? If so, why? And what might such trends mean for American constitutional democracy? In a debate otherwise dominated by law professors&#8212;and largely without careful empirical analysis&#8212;we place the issue of judicial tenure in historical perspective, with special attention to the institutional development of the Court, the changing politics of the appointments process and the types of individuals who emerge from it, and to a lesser extent, broader socio-demographic trends in technology and medicine. In the process, we show how proponents of reforms designed to end life tenure have ignored a significant factor influencing patterns in judicial service: the decline of the &#8220;short-term&#8221; justice. Trends in judicial tenure, we argue, cannot be explained by more justices serving unusually long terms; rather, they are driven at least in part by the fact that fewer justices are serving relatively short terms. In this article, we consider why justices have retired after only short service throughout much of history, why they rarely do so today, the conditions under which future justices might be compelled to serve shorter terms, and the democratic gains and losses associated with short-term service on the Court. In sum, by following the rise and fall of the short-term justice over the course of American political development, we offer a new perspective, grounded in political science, on an issue currently occupying the attention of lawyers, journalists, and policymakers alike. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707071472","425-445","and Christopher F.

It shows that terrorists and leaders of renegade regimes are neither mindless nor irrational, but rather are often sensitive to the costs of punishment and thus susceptible to the logic of deterrence. Deterrence doctrines should therefore not be abandoned as Cold War relics, and the book makes a remarkable contribution toward bridging the doctrinal issues and debates from the Cold War (nuclear deterrence) past to the current problems of antiproliferation and counterterrorism.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270707274X","869-870","Vesna Danilovic","University at Buffalo, SUNY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1327","312"

They define delegation as a revocable &#8220;grant of authority&#8221; from one or more &#8220;principal(s)&#8221; to an &#8220;agent,&#8221; which enables &#8220;the latter to act on behalf of the former&#8221; in a specified domain and/or for a limited period of time. The agent's discretion in how to pursue the principal's objectives is a direct inverse function of the precision of the rules laid down by the principal. Agent autonomy, by contrast, is defined as the possible range of actions the agent can take contrary to the principal's interests, net whatever mechanism the principal may have put in place to control the agent. To the extent that an agent actually pursues his own interests contrary to the principal's, we see agencyslack.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072684","861-862","Tim B&uuml;the","Duke University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This assertion caused this reviewer to nod in agreement, but it heightened my expectations for what Drezner would produce. These expectations grew as he identified promulgators of &#8220;bad international relations theory,&#8221; which ranged from commentators, such as Thomas Friedman, to schools of international relations theory, including realism and liberal institutionalism, but especially theories that privilege the agency of nonstate actors in world politics.

By Conor O'Dwyer. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. 278p. $49.95.This first book by Conor O'Dwyer adds to a growing and impressive collection of works on state building in postcommunist countries. In it he seeks to explain the variation in the growth of large patronage networks in state administrations in three central European countries&#8212;Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. In doing so, he looks to the relationship between the establishment of strong party systems and the ability of states to withstand the emergence of extensive patronage networks. Specifically, he posits (p. 13) that &#8220;the magnitude and character of administrative expansion is determined by the capacity of party competition to constrain patronage.&#8221; He concludes that taking all considerations into account, it is the presence or absence of a strongly competitive party system that most clearly explains the sleek state administrative structures in the Czech Republic and the bloated bureaucracy in Poland and Slovakia. The failure of these two countries, whose leaders had so keenly sought to dismantle the communist nomenklatura system, to gain control of what O'Dwyer calls &#8220;runaway state-building&#8221; is richly detailed and persuasively argued in this excellent book.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072611","851-853","Karen Dawisha","Miami University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","748","153"

This work also takes into account the growing amount of scholarship being produced by the Chinese themselves.

She wants to explain &#8220;why and how actors on the receiving end of campaigns put forward alternative understandings of human rights norms&#8221; (p. 3). Building on Margaret Keck and Kathryn Sikkink's groundbreaking modeling of the &#8220;boomerang effect&#8221; of transnational campaigns (see ActivistsBeyondBorders:TransnationalAdvocacyNetworksinInternationalPolitics, 1998), Hertel identifies two new patterns of campaign emergence, which she calls the &#8220;outside-in&#8221; pattern and the &#8220;dual-target&#8221; pattern. Outside-in patterns are at work when campaigns are framed outside of the targeted area, generally in the global North, and then introduced to change conditions in targeted countries. Dual-target patterns, by contrast, evolve around collaborations and shared interests of outside and inside actors to change human rights conditions in both the sender and receiver countries (p. 25). Both of these patterns, argues the author, reflect more accurately than previous formulations the contentious frame negotiations that go on in such campaigns.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072568","846-847","Sabine Lang","University of Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","731","129"

By Diana Gordon. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 2006. 400p. $78.00 cloth, $28.95 paper.When the African National Congress (ANC) took power in South Africa after the first open elections in 1994, the goals of its leaders were ambitious: In addition to securing liberal rights and institutions, the party sought to address the socioeconomic needs of an impoverished population and deepen mass participation in the public sphere. In its own words, it pursued transformation: not just the transition to democracy, but the deepening and enriching of democracy that comes with true consolidation. Diana Gordon's magisterial book tracks the country's progress in one aspect of transformation: the reform of the criminal justice system. As Gordon suggests, the criminal justice system was an obvious institution to tackle: The police and courts had been the frontline enforcers of apartheid's laws. Furthermore, geared around defending the racial hierarchy instead of crime control, the existing system struggled mightily to deal with epic levels of violent crime besieging the new democracy. Only through the complete reform of these institutions could the country achieve democratic consolidation and secure the peace. In assessing South Africa's successes and failures in pursuing justice-system reform, the author makes important contributions to various literatures, including the study of criminal justice, deliberative democracy, democratization, and South African politics.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072556","844-845","Karen Ferree","University of California&#8211;San Diego","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","847","138"

The underlying data is comprehensive enough to allow these lives to be understood across a broad spectrum of institutionalizations&#8212;structures, moreover, that exhibit a greater range of formalization than those captured by census data or other aggregate statistics. Thus, the data allow finer distinctions between phases in labor market adjustment, job mobility, and the lateral or vertical shifts involved with such changes.

Eric Davis argues that the focus on overt state repression that has dominated studies of Iraq overlooks the state's use of historical memory as a mechanism of control. Employing a Gramscian model, he examines how successive Iraqi regimes have sought to use historical memory to claim legitimacy and authenticity and thus undermine political challengers. Yet these state-initiated projects remain incomplete, and Davis concludes that the political and social instability of Iraq is in large part due to &#8220;the inability of Iraqis to construct a viable model for political community&#8221; through a shared vision of historical memory (p. 2). His two main themes&#8212;the efforts of successive regimes to put historical memories to political use and the diverse ways in which the intelligentsia support or challenge these projects&#8212;are documented in impressive detail. After an introductory theoretical chapter, the argument unfolds largely in chronological fashion, beginning with the formation of the Iraqi intelligentsia and competing visions of modern Iraqi historical memory. The majority of the book is then devoted to a systematic examination of these themes from the early twentieth century through fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072519","839-841","Jillian Schwedler","University of Massachusetts&#8211;Amherst","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","823","207"

J&oacute;hanna Krist&iacute;n Birnir's EthnicityandElectoralPolitics and Erin K. Jenne's EthnicBargaining are reflective of these qualities and make strong contributions to the field of ethnic politics. Both books make striking claims about contemporary debates in communal politics research and employ a broad array of empirical tools to test their core hypotheses. At the same time, they diverge regarding the implications of political liberalization and the greater political latitude it affords organized ethnic communities.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072490","835-837","Brian Shoup","Indiana University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","826","205"

By John Fabian Witt. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004. 322p. $55.00 cloth, $18.95 paper.The development of workmen's compensation legislation is a subject of considerable historical interest. As the first major social insurance program adopted in the United States, it is also a story that may shed light on the broader question of why welfare state development in the United States differs so markedly from that observed in many other industrialized countries. In this engaging book, John Fabian Witt traces the development of legal ideas and public responses to the problem of industrial accidents during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This is first and foremost a legal history, but it should nonetheless be of considerable interest to political scientists and, in particular, those interested in the subject of welfare state development. Witt argues that the problem of industrial accidents led to a series of legal and institutional responses that involved a fundamental reconceptualization of the problem of risk and that helped influence the subsequent development of the American welfare state through the New Deal years. More provocatively, he suggests that these legal and institutional responses were a contingent or accidental outcome. Alternative responses to the problem of industrial accidents might have led to an alternative path of welfare state development.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072477","833-834","David Stasavage","New York University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","610","34"

By Colleen J. Shogan. College Station: Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2006. 230p. $45.00 cloth, $22.95 paper.This work offers a relevant, theoretically rich discussion of rhetorical strategies pursued by presidents from George Washington to George W. Bush. Colleen Shogan's accomplishment is striking not only because it is the rare presidential study that accounts for all the nation's chief executives but also because it exists at the intersection of two important, and in some respects competing, theories of presidential power, Stephen Skowronek's (1993) ThePoliticsPresidentsMake and Jeffrey Tulis's (1987) TheRhetoricalPresidency. Like Skowronek, Shogan recovers the premodern presidencies, which are too often ignored, and links them to their successors by focusing on comparable political environments. This allows for fascinating and surprising conclusions across eras. Like Tulis, she focuses on rhetoric as a strategic tool that, on the one hand, can help presidents overcome constitutional limitations but, on the other hand, can raise public expectations beyond reasonable bounds. Also like Tulis, she finds Woodrow Wilson to be an important transitional figure, albeit in a more limited way. Far from introducing moralizing to presidential rhetoric, Shogan demonstrates that Wilson was the first to engage heavily in moralizing without reference to a specific policy goal, a tactic continued by Wilson's successors.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072465","832-833","David B.

By Kevin M. Kruse. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005. 352p. $35.00 cloth, $18.95 paper.The South is a region of many myths, and Kevin Kruse takes on one of the most durable of them: Atlanta as the &#8220;city too busy to hate.&#8221; Kruse finds that Atlanta, like many other southern and northern cities in the postwar era, was a city in which &#8220;race and residence stood at the forefront of [Atlanta's] racial politics&#8221; (p. 42). He traces the ultimately unsuccessful efforts of Mayor William Hartsfield's biracial, elite-controlled regime to manage the struggle between whites and blacks over urban space. White flight, the decades-long movement of whites to the Atlanta suburbs, was not only the result of this struggle over space; it was also the source of a new form of southern white conservatism based on whites' resentful exit from the urban South. For political scientists, this book is a reminder of the &#8220;long civil rights movement,&#8221; that began in the 1940s, before the Brown decision, and extended throughout the 1970s. At the local level, the Civil Rights movement was a struggle over politics that earlier political scientists would be quick to understand and appreciate: a struggle over who gets what, when, where, and how. By taking an in-depth yet rigorous look at southern politics that goes beyond the limitations of National Election Study data or roll-call votes, the book provides valuable historical context to recent works on the transformation of southern politics.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072453","830-832","Kimberley S.

Until now, however, no comprehensive examination of their contemporary legislative influence has been conducted. The need for such a study is clear, and Tyson King-Meadows and Thomas Schaller's research&#8212;part of the SUNY Series in African American Studies&#8212;is rooted in an interesting set of political trends. Since the Reagan Revolution of the early 1980s and the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, devolution (or new federalism) has pushed much power and many resources (though some would argue not enough resources) to the states. At the same time, since the early 1980s the number of black state legislators has increased substantially. The authors want to know whether these two trends have resulted in greater real (as opposed to symbolic or descriptive) representation of African American interests in state policy.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007. 282p. $28.00.One of the cornerstones of Woodrow Wilson's policy agenda, even before he formally sought the presidency, was transparency. To neutralize corporate misbehavior, for instance, he called for &#8220;turn[ing] the light&#8221; on corporations: &#8220;They don't like light. Turn it on so strong they can't stand it. Exposure is one of the best ways to whip them into line.&#8221; Although the authors of this superb work do not acknowledge Wilson's part in the evolutionary line of transparency policy, they do show by means of thorough and enlightening description and analysis the fruit finally borne of ideas like those Wilson espoused. Indeed, the authors tell a story of policy design that demonstrates the continuing value of careful legislative craftsmanship and policy refinement over time, based on feedback from administration and enforcement. It is a tale of effective legislative governance, particularly at the national level, that far too many American citizens, and even political leaders, believe is impossible or at least unlikely anymore.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270707243X","828-829","Brian J.

By Daniel J. Fiorino. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2006. 290p. $23.00.The subject matter of this book is not exactly what its title suggests. The author's attention is limited to industrial pollution regulatory policy in the United States, rather than focusing on environmental regulation more broadly. And the &#8220;new&#8221; regulation it touts is not really all that new. Daniel Fiorino does not describe and analyze something that has been invented recently, say, in the last five to 10 years, nor does he propose something wholly original or novel that has never before been tried or imagined. Many of the regulatory tools that he lumps together under the label of &#8220;new&#8221; can be traced back decades, some to even before the modern federal pollution regulatory era began in 1970, and so many of them are as old as or older than much of his &#8220;old&#8221; pollution regulation. Fiorino uses the adjective &#8220;new&#8221; because it is an inherently appealing, future-oriented label whether one is selling soap, politicians, or ideas. Although &#8220;old&#8221; hints at something worn out, no longer desirable, and perhaps near death, he does not want to bury the old regulation: &#8220;Designing and implementing a new regulation does not mean that we should do away with the old one&#8221; (p. 190). By using &#8220;old&#8221; as his label of convenience, he at least sidesteps an ideological minefield by avoiding the also-loaded label &#8220;command and control,&#8221; which is often used by political critics of adversarial, directive regulation in the public interest.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072428","827-828","Robert V.

As the House deliberated, the governors of Massachusetts and Virginia readied their militias to prevent each other's favorite son from stealing the election.

While drawing from current theories of language, White does not quite belong in the postmodern tradition because he searches for authentic representations of thoughts and emotions. This brings him closer to phenomenology. His title phrase, &#8220;living speech,&#8221; taken from Simone Weil, sets forth his primary argument. He makes a distinction between living speech, which represents genuine, creative thought, and &#8220;dead speech,&#8221; which reiterates slogans, clich&eacute;s, and speech patterns from a culture's ideologies, including advertising and propaganda. Dead speech endeavors to get the listener to act in a prescribed way, while living speech tries to persuade the listener to see the virtues of an argument. White's goal is to encourage living speech in order to move societies closer to love and justice. Like the postmoderns, he believes that speech is the foundational human activity because it conveys the imagination, but unlike postmoderns, he wants to talk about the ways in which speech articulates aspects of a human mind by making meaning.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072350","817-819","Eloise A.

One notable example, of course, is the way in which the feminist movement in the 1960s brought about not only important transformations in our understanding of the history of political thought (e.g., in terms of the troubling position of many canonical theorists on the &#8220;private&#8221; status of women), but also new ways to reconceptualize politics today. With the &#8220;ecological challenge&#8221; confronting the world today, it is no wonder that there is now a new subfield within the discipline of political theory (in the United States, at least, it goes under the name of &#8220;environmental political theory&#8221;), one that is involved in a major rethinking of the history of political thought, not to mention the deconstruction and reconstruction of important political traditions and concepts to meet these challenges.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072301","810-812","Bradley J.

In political science, one such wave arrived with the advent and aftermath of the so-called behavioral revolution. Roughly a quarter century later, in October 2000, the self-named Perestroika rebellion inspired another wave of intense interest in the proper conduct of political inquiry. Unlike the earlier wave, the Perestroika movement failed initially to generate much compelling discussion of methodological issues. To be sure, it elicited numerous expressions of discontent with the hegemonic influence of rational choice theory and quantitative methods, as well as vocal demands for greater methodological pluralism, problem-driven research, and political &#8220;relevance.&#8221; In addition, the proponents of Perestroika raised serious questions about the institutional structures and intellectual orthodoxies that have organized academic political inquiry in the United States over the past few decades. Yet these expressions of discontent and demands for reform were rarely accompanied by creative thought about the nature of political inquiry or compelling visions of alternatives to the present hegemony. Consequently, those scholars who hoped that the Perestroika revolt might rejuvenate the increasingly moribund literature on methodologies of political inquiry were sorely disappointed. Instead of providing powerfully articulated defenses of or alternatives to the methodological axioms of our age, the Perestroika controversy all too often issued in amorphous proposals and empty platitudes.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072295","805-810","Keith Topper","Northwestern University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1033","204"

The Program of the APSA meetings is one sign of this. The range of books reviewed in any given issue of Perspectives is another. In general we run reviews as we receive them. There is no long-range thematic plan beyond the review essays. And yet it is striking how certain patterns emerge in each issue. Perhaps the patterns I observe when I write these editorial introductions are subconsciously imposed in the editorial process. Perhaps they are simply artifacts of the way I retrospectively read the reviews. Obviously each reader can discern their own patterns, and we hope that they will. My own discernments are intended only as a guide and a prompt. They are motivated by the fact that, for perhaps good reasons including efficiency, most of us tend to read only the reviews in &#8220;our&#8221; subfields.

We argue that the extra work required in producing graphs is rewarded by greatly enhanced presentation and communication of empirical results. We illustrate their benefits by turning several published tables into graphs, including tables that present descriptive data and regression results. We show that regression graphs emphasize point estimates and confidence intervals and that they can successfully present the results of regression models.

Interest balancing interest lies at the core of the Liberal solution to the problem of anarchy, power, and human nature, whether in politics, economics, or the international sphere. Liberal scholars have adopted instead a rationalist utilitarian or a normative democratic approach. At the same time, Realists in international relations predict a balance, which realist scholars in domestic politics, like Schattschneider, have effectively questioned. This intellectual confusion denies Liberal theory a robust view of international politics, not least because the balancing principle is erroneously rejected as conservative. The confusion also undermines the coherence of Realist theory, which has hitherto tried to accommodate opposing predictions (balance of power and power concentrations) under one paradigm. I offer an explanation of how this conflation of theories arose. Conflating Liberalism with idealism leaves Realism as the only prudent alternative in international politics. The relation between the two theories is not zero-sum: both capture important aspects of international dynamics, and each can ignore the other only at serious cost. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072180","703-727","Deborah Boucoyannis","Harvard University, E-mail: <a href=mailto:boucoyan@fas.harvard.edu>boucoyan@fas.harvard.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2612","794"

This article seeks to formulate a critical theory of zealotry and investigate its relationship to democracy through a close reading of the speeches of the radical abolitionist orator Wendell Phillips. The American abolitionists were passionate democrats. Yet many of them, such as Phillips, were also self-defined fanatics who believed in using extremist language and tactics on behalf of the slave. Phillips&#39;s speeches suggest a specifically political definition of zealotry as a strategy that seeks to mobilize populations in defense of a particular position by dividing the public sphere into friends (those who support the position) and enemies (those who oppose it) and pressuring the moderates in between. Through his defense of fanaticism and his argument for disunion, Phillips articulates a democratic form of fanaticism that challenges common pejorative associations of zealotry with irrationality, intolerance, fundamentalism, or terrorism. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592707072179","685-701","Joel Olson","Northern Arizona University, E-mail: <a href=mailto:joel.olson@nau.edu>joel.olson@nau.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3257","683"

By H. V. Savitch and Paul Kantor. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002. 488p. $65.00 cloth, $19.95 paper.The growing popularity of comparative research is one of the most exciting recent developments in the field of urban politics. Comparison allows urbanists to transcend the local and see cities as part of a national or global system. It helps urban scholars identify which factors derive from the workings of democratic capitalist systems, and which grow from particular national practices and policies. But comparative urbanists have a difficult task as they try to disentangle cities from their national contexts. On the one hand, one can hardly understand, say, education policy in Detroit and D&uuml;sseldorf without clarifying local and national roles. On the other, an urbanist eager to highlight what is salient about the local does not wish to make national policy analysis central to his or her research. These special theoretical and methodological challenges confronting the comparative urbanist can be daunting.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706890146","236-237","Elizabeth Strom","University of South Florida","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","557","89"

President George W. Bush justified the United States March 2003 invasion of Iraq as the preservation and enhancing of that order and of the United Nations itself. A few months later, the UN secretary general suggested that the U.S. invasion was illegal. And even if one grants the emergence of a nascent global political order, its character is uncertain: Is it democratic, consensual, and egalitarian, or hierarchical and undemocratic?<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270688014X","235-236","Neta C.

As a result of this body of work, policymakers now have better tools with which to predict massive human rights abuses, and fewer excuses to hide behind when confronted with potential or ongoing atrocities. Yet much more needs to be done. On the policymaking side, mass killings continue unabated, with few international actors willing to address them head-on. On the academic side, we have spent so much time and intellectual capital on the structural factors that allow, encourage, exacerbate, or inhibit atrocities that we have often neglected the role of the perpetrators themselves. The two books reviewed here take on this deficit in the literature. These important new books convincingly argue that in order to understand and address the most egregious human rights violations, we must begin with those responsible for devising and implementing these murderous policies.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706870143","233-235","Matthew Krain","The College of Wooster","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1209","247"

Lucas argues that the regime has focused what he calls throughout the analysis &#8220;survival strategies&#8221; on three centers of political and civil society: political parties, the parliament, and the press. These strategies have enjoyed varying degrees of success, and the analysis concentrates on three factors&#8212;he does not prioritize them or give an indication of how much they explain&#8212;that have influenced the success or failure of the survival strategies: &#8220;the resourceful use of constitutional rules by the regime; the reinforcement of the opposition's disunity of collective action [sic] against the survival strategy and the regime's policies, and the attention to not imposing costs on sectors of the regime coalition that could fray its unity&#8221; (p. 2).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706710143","213-214","Laurie A.

By Neil Gilbert. New York: Oxford University Press, 2002. 224p. $39.95 cloth, $16.95 paper.For more than a decade, students of social policy have debated the argument that welfare state development is a path-dependent process that makes radical change difficult (see Paul Pierson, DismantlingtheWelfareState? [1994]). From this perspective, existing policy legacies create powerful constraints for policymakers seeking to enact retrenchment measures or to alter the functioning of the welfare state. As a result, most reforms tend to reinforce existing institutional patterns instead of changing them in a strong way. In recent years, authors such as Neil Gilbert have challenged this view. In TransformationoftheWelfareState, he challenges Pierson's argument through a broad analysis of social policy development in the United States and Western Europe during the 1980s and 1990s.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706680146","210-211","Daniel B&eacute;land","University of Calgary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","704","189"

Indeed, while the question was pertinent before the tragedy of September 11 in 2001 and the American invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003, it has become exponentially more urgent since. Although the difficulties of incorporating Muslim populations into the countries receiving them were neither a cause of nor directly connected to the aforementioned events, the negative chain reaction they subsequently precipitated within and outside of the diverse Muslim community within Western Europe nevertheless exposed serious tensions between many of the community's religious practices and the dominant cultural, social, and political mores of the host societies.

By asking a range of pointed questions on judicial reform whose answers have largely been assumed, Hiram E. Chodosh lays bare basic concepts and debates in order to understand whether they are truly logical, consistent, and useful. The scrutiny with which the author subjects the field of comparative law helps make it much more rigorous, since, as he points out, even an empirically rich comparative framework will result in poor findings if its methodology is inconsistent and its objectives unclear. He carefully explains comparative method, illuminates approaches ranging from cross-national comparisons to intranational comparisons, and analyzes benefits of comparisons, such as the creation of continuums. With this comprehensive and insightful assessment, he criticizes comparative law's failure to adopt a method for objectively assessing the results and value of a comparison that is &#8220;flexible enough to grasp a wide variety&#8221; of processes and institutions (p. 17). He shows how classifications, prototypes, evaluation mechanisms, and other building blocks of comparative study are often too deterministic or unclear, and how the lack of objective criteria leaves central debates&#8212;such as over the wisdom and practicality of transferring a feature of one country's legal system to another&#8212;unresolved. &#8220;Without clarity of purpose,&#8221; he concludes,&#8221; it is difficult to determine the content of what to report&#8221; (p. 16).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706650147","206-207","Mark Ungar","Brooklyn College, CUNY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","525","130"

To Castles, however, these explanations rest on faulty empirical evidence. Methodological problems&#8212;in particular, unreliable comparative social expenditure data and overreliance on pooled designs and statistical techniques&#8212;have made it impossible to distinguish &#8220;crisis myths&#8221; from &#8220;crisis realities.&#8221; His proposed solution is to combine cross-national designs with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's SOCX database on social spending, and he argues that doing so reveals that dominant theories are myths.

By Yesim Arat. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2005. 150p. $55.00.Since the advent of competitive politics in Turkey in 1946, Islamist parties have assumed increasing importance. During the 1970s, the National Salvation Party, headed by Necmettin Erbakan, was a participant in a series of coalition governments. The Welfare Party, also led by Erbakan, came in first (barely) in the 1995 election, catapulting its temperamental leader into the position of prime minister. In 2002, the Justice and Development Party (JDP) won an overwhelming electoral victory, capturing two-thirds of the parliamentary seats. Although the JDP denies that it is an Islamist party, its leader, the current prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been a leading Islamist politician, including especially his stormy career as mayor of Istanbul, and both its supporters and opponents regard it as such today. The result of this dramatic rise of Islamist political forces in the formally and solidly secular Republic of Turkey has aroused a great deal of controversy. Not least of the questions raised is the popular conundrum of the compatibility of Islam and democracy.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706630144","203-204","Frank Tachau","University of Illinois at Chicago","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mass privatization was a unique program that defined postcommunist economic transitions in the 1990s and was adopted in numerous countries. Launched first in the Czech Republic in 1991, this innovative method of privatization was adopted in many other postcommunist countries. The rationale for mass privatization was simple: Since people did not have the money to buy state-owned enterprises, the state could give them away. To distribute ownership widely throughout the formerly expropriated population, the state would distribute shares in state-owned enterprises to millions of small shareholders in exchange for free or nearly free vouchers. Mass privatization would divest the state of thousands of state enterprises, while creating a broad-based class of shareholders after decades of communism.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706620148","202-203","Mitchell Orenstein","Syracuse University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","578","167"

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005. 336p. $24.00.In opposition to the recent trend in democratization studies that sees this process as if the glass is half empty, this study of Nicaraguan democratization argues that the glass is half full. Recent history in Nicaragua includes momentous events, such as the fall of the Somoza dictatorship in 1979, the triumph of the Sandinista revolution, the subsequent Sandinista electoral victory in the presidential contest of 1984, and their later defeat in 1990, when voters rejected Daniel Ortega in favor of the mild-mannered, conservative Violeta Chamorro. Noting the voters' continuous embrace of what the authors call &#8220;democratic conservatism,&#8221; they conclude that &#8220;Nicaragua appears to be evolving into an inclusive, constitutional democracy&#8221; (p. 280). How was this possible, especially in a country that exhibited so few of the prerequisites traditionally associated with the successful establishment of democracy? And why did voters, the majority of them poor, reject the Sandinistas in 1990 and later elections, favoring candidates that came to undo most of what the Sandinistas had achieved in terms of social and economic equality?

How could a system once praised for its ability to handle economic shocks such as the two oil shocks and a massive reevaluation of the Yen suddenly stall and prove unable to adapt to changing conditions?

Harold Spaeth was among the pioneers in this research and is now regarded as its strongest adherent. The justification for the Supreme Court Attitudinal Model, known to friends and foes alike by the acronym &#8220;SCAM,&#8221; is relatively simple: The preponderance of individual-level decision making can be explained as a function of the attitudes of the justices. Like the ideal model, it is parsimonious and explains a great deal of variance.

The new regulations generally require close interaction between benefit recipients (often disingenuously termed &#8220;customers&#8221;) and local agency personnel.

With the amendments of 1950, an additional 10 million additional people were covered, including some of the poorest&#8212;domestic and agricultural workers. By using the payroll tax to support Social Security payments, citizens saw the program as one to which they contributed and from which they should receive. Even in very different times 55 years later, Americans continued to support this approach to public pensions. Despite comparatively low levels of trust in government and decades of antitax and antigovernment movement successes, President George W.

By Amihai Glazer and Lawrence S. Rothenberg. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005. 224p. $42.00 cloth, $18.95 paper.In a 1964 book review (&#8220;American Business, Public Policy, Case Studies, and Political Theory, WorldPolitics 16 [4]: 677, 693&#8211;715), Theodore Lowi challenged the conventional wisdom that politics determined policy. The causal relationship, he argued, ran in the opposite direction: &#8220;[F]or every type of policy there is likely to be a distinctive type of political relationship&#8221; (1964, 688). In their bold effort to explain why government succeeds (and why it fails), Amihai Glazer and Lawrence Rothenberg again prompt us to examine the relationship between politics and policy, this time by setting the &#8220;political machinations&#8221; of politicians and interest groups to the side in order to ask: How do economic conditions impact the success or failure of a public policy? To try to determine the success or failure of a policy by examining &#8220;only the interaction between politicians and constituencies is like investigating the efficacy of medical treatment by looking only at the motives of physicians and ignoring the biology of different diseases&#8221; (p. 2). For Glazer and Rothenberg, an exclusive focus on politics ignores the &#8220;biology&#8221; (so to speak) of different policies that are best discovered by examining the ways in which rational economic actors respond to government actions. More specifically, they argue that an analysis of public policy based upon four economic constraints&#8212;credibility, rational expectations, crowding out or in, and multiple equilibria&#8212;will help reveal the kinds of problems that government is most likely able to solve, and why.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706470146","184-185","Anne M.

By Ren&eacute;e Ann Cramer. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2005. 224p. $24.95.The literature of tribal politics and federal Indian law has largely been the province of law reviews and legal scholars. The subject matter is complicated, confusing, and contradictory. There are more than 500 Indian tribes and native villages that have been acknowledged (recognized) by the federal government, and each of these governments is unique in its history, heritage, culture, language, and land. Unlike other governments within the United States, tribal governments have no constitutional basis; therefore, they have been treated over the years by the United States as foreign nations (treaties and wars), as wards of the government (reservations and trust status), and as sovereign dependent nations. Federal Indian law is rendered more obscure by the fact that it affects less than 2% of the American population, and that, largely rural, population has the highest rate of poverty and unemployment in the country. All of these factors have led the First Americans to be highly marginalized in American politics, both by politicians and political scientists. This recently changed when the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) (1988), allowed gaming on Indian reservations, if the states wherein they were located allowed such gambling even under restricted conditions. The success of Indian gaming establishments has produced a type of Indian Renaissance, but only for federally acknowledged tribes. Indian tribes and communities that are not federally acknowledged have been unable to share in these economic and cultural benefits. Federal acknowledgment is the critical factor in the success of an Indian tribe in maintaining its sovereignty, culture, economy, and land base. Without federal acknowledgment, a tribe is not a tribe and its members are not Indians, regardless of heritage.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706430140","179-180","Anne M.

It will also prove to be tough sledding for many biologists and political scientists alike. Political scientists will be challenged by the author's understanding of the language, logic, and findings of genetics and the human genomics (his detailed analysis of techniques of genetic analysis, for instance, will be alien to many political scientists). Biologists will be hard-pressed at times to get a handle on the political side of the book (e.g., throwaway references to &#8220;strict scrutiny&#8221; may be obscure to biologists not familiar with American constitutional doctrine). Thus, a number of readers may well find it frustrating to launch into this book. The author himself acknowledges this when he says (p. xii): &#8220;The study may be hard going for some political scientists. It will also probably be hard going for genomicists.

There are now many books and articles that examine the promises and pitfalls of ERD. For the uninitiated, EDR can include any type of conflict or dispute resolution that falls outside of the normal state or federal judicial or bureaucratic system. This can include everything from negotiation, mediation, and arbitration (commonly used in the legal system&#8212;and not typically thought of as EDR) to things with names like collaborative, cooperative, or collective management and adaptive governance. The normally cited perquisites for ERD are that the negotiations be voluntary, that the parties participate in the process directly, that participants may withdraw from the process at any time, that third-party facilitators have no formal authority to impose a decision, and that the parties agree to whatever is decided. If this sounds like getting people together to talk and work things out, that is because this is what it is.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706400141","176-177","Zachary A.

More significantly, it tries to suggest, though very sketchily, what a unitary actor with strategic acumen and a leftist program might look like, given the decline of parties of the working class and the fragmentation of emancipatory social movements.

It is regularly proclaimed as both a principle of war and a principle of peace, as a necessary component of free market capitalism and the name of resistance to economic globalization, as that which legitimates the power of the nation-state and that which perpetually threatens to undermine that power. As such, democracy risks becoming one of those worn-out coins that Friedrich Nietzsche invokes, &#8220;drained of sensuous force&#8221; (PhilosophyandTruth, 1979, 84).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270630014X","163-164","Jason Frank","Cornell University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","694","224"

By Ellen Kennedy. Durham: Duke University Press, 2004. 272p. $79.95 cloth, $22.95 paper.Carl Schmitt's 1933 involvement with national socialism constitutes a frequent interpretative entry point into his work. From there, his pre-Weimar as well as his post&#8211;World War II writings become logically implicated with his infamous role as the Third Reich's &#8220;Crown Jurist.&#8221; It is the merit of Ellen Kennedy to break away from this dominant, often redundant, trend to offer an original reading of Schmitt's constitutional and political theory. Instead of debating whether his endorsement of Nazism was a matter of principle, Kennedy boldly shifts direction to address broader, more interesting theoretical issues prompted by his writings.

Mussolini'sIntellectuals is the conclusion of 40 years of scholarship on fascist intellectuals and the ideology they produced. While specialists will find little if anything new in this volume, the uninitiated will find a cogent presentation of the author's long-standing claim: that Italian fascism was not simply the violent, irrational, anti-intellectual phenomenon so often misrepresented in the historical and social scientific literature but, rather, a movement with a serious ideological core that responded to the historical failings of the liberal state, as well as to the conjunctural problems of the interwar period.

The first of these tasks is efficiently done (in the final section), and as well as offering Galston the chance to modify some previous overstatements of his position (for example, to tone down his criticism of the idea of personal autonomy), the book provides a useful summary of the current state of various philosophical controversies surrounding the politics of liberalism. However the real interest lies in his attempt to make pluralism a practical political doctrine in its own right. Here, his success is mixed. His argument is most persuasive when he is criticizing excessively &#8220;monistic&#8221; or, as he calls them, &#8220;totalist&#8221; conceptions of liberal politics. The problem is that these criticisms often appear unobjectionable precisely because they are only weakly connected to a distinctively pluralist alternative.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706270142","159-160","David Runciman","Cambridge University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","585","195"

New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. 272p. $29.95.In HowPatrioticIsthePatriotAct? Amitai Etzioni analyzes the United States response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, from the perspective of &#8220;responsive&#8221; or &#8220;new&#8221; communitarianism. New communitarianism, according to the author, can be distinguished from authoritarian communitarianism because it seeks a balance between freedom and security or social order (pp. 3&#8211;4). According to Etzioni, during the 1960s and 1970s, America &#8220;overcorrected&#8221; for forms of authoritarian government, such as racial segregation or J. Edgar Hoover's Federal Bureau of Investigation. As a result, the country experienced &#8220;excessive individualism&#8221; and &#8220;moral anomie.&#8221; With what he considers to have been an overemphasis on individual rights, certain policies, such as the possibility of a quarantine in the face of bioterrorism or highly communicable disease, have been &#8220;stigmatized&#8221; as being &#8220;beyond the pale&#8221; of reasonable discussion (pp. 87&#8211;89). By noting, for example, that the United States has allowed for quarantines at earlier junctures in its history and that a quarantine could be set up on a vacation island, he is clearly trying to rehabilitate the quarantine as a policy option. But this is just one policy among many that are emerging post&#8211;September 11 in the United States that are correcting the balance between liberty and security, for Etzioni. That is, he understands policies such as the USA Patriot Act, US VISIT (U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indication Technology program), CAPPS II (a proposed measure to update the current Computer Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening System (CAPPS) airline security program that was subsequently killed in the summer of 2004 because of its burden on civil liberties), national identification cards, and various biometric and facial recognition technologies to be relocating a balance between freedom and security that was apparently lost in the 1960s and 1970s.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706260146","157-159","Paul A.

Christopher Colmo argues that Alfarabi breaks with Plato and Aristotle. In other words, contrary to Leo Strauss and others (among whom I count myself), Alfarabi is not, among other things, a useful guide to the recovery of a forgotten Plato and Aristotle. At his most ambitious, Colmo insinuates that Alfarabi offers a third path between the metaphysically grounded politics of the ancients and the moderns' excessive reliance on philosophic concepts such as human rights (p. 168). This third way is often referred to as the &#8220;autonomy of politics&#8221; from theory.

Bronner contends that many criticisms of Enlightenment thought today can be traced to what he characterizes as Horkheimer and Adorno's brilliant but ultimately inaccurate and misleading analysis. The losses involved are not only scholarly but political, Bronner argues, for progressive activists and intellectuals today can benefit from the ethical orientations and philosophical temperaments that informed Enlightenment thinkers. ReclaimingtheEnlightenment is also a response to historians of political thought who have too often, in Bronner's opinion, missed the forest for the trees. While the recent historiography of Enlightenment thought has deepened and broadened our understanding of particular figures, themes, and regional variants of eighteenth-century political philosophy, he contends that the contemporary emphasis on multiple Enlightenments can have the effect of obscuring what he takes to be the fundamental ethos of Enlightenment thought.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706230147","153-154","Sankar Muthu","Princeton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","758","217"

At one level, it should make political theorists generally&#8212;whether or not they consider themselves &#8220;ecological theorists&#8221;&#8212;reflect more systematically on how concepts of nature structure the ideas of canonical thinkers. Political ecology is too often treated like a specialty shop in the theory emporium, a boutique that one enters or not according to the inclinations of taste. In fact, its insights recast the central concerns of political theory broadly conceived. Just as feminists have uncovered how gendered concepts are woven throughout the entire fabric of political discourse, so ecological political theorists demonstrate how nature in multiple guises (wildness, savagery, emotional connectedness, fecundity, scarcity, etc.) subtly inflects the meaning of notions of rights, justice, and human well-being. In this regard, Biro's perceptive analyses of Rousseau and Marx&#8212;like John Meyer's reading of Aristotle and Hobbes in PoliticalNature (2001)&#8212;add heft to a growing literature that, in the name of environmental concern, wrings new meaning from familiar theorists.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706220140","152-153","Kerry H.

Bernstein succeeds in celebrating his career, not only through the editors' insightful introduction and the excellent biographical essay by Judith Friedlander but also through 13 significant essays and an excerpt from Shoshana Yovel's novel that speaks with keen philosophical insight on radical evil. As the editors say, one of the distinctive contributions of Bernstein to philosophy is a view of social critique that encompasses normative as well as empirical and interpretive dimensions and that employs a form of pragmatic reason both dialogical in nature and political in its implications (p. xiii). The contributors draw upon Bernstein's approach to salvage what Jerome Kohn, in his fine essay based on Kant's CritiqueofJudgment, understands to be a &#8220;common world&#8221; that is &#8220;fit for human habitation&#8221; (pp. 270&#8211;74). The latter is the location for self-creation and for the freedom that sustains it. Nonetheless, self-creation is threatened by the totalitarian mind, which is intent upon using its freedom to destroy all freedom. As a counter, the essays in this volume embrace what the editors refer to as Bernstein's &#8220;Deweyan view of philosophy as the self-reflection of democratic society&#8221; and thereby make self-creation the centerpiece of human flourishing (p. viii).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706210144","151-152","Steven M.

In order that just institutions be designed fairly, we will not be allowed to reason from our own particular circumstances. We are not to know our own race or religion, our own material resources, or even our own personal abilities and whether these abilities are valued by our society. Imagine that once this &#8220;veil of ignorance&#8221; about ourselves is lifted, we might discover that we are the person least advantaged by racist social norms or least advantaged by the relative value that our society places on skills (for example, that we have the skills of a seamstress, not of a professional basketball player). In this view of the bases for an agreement about first principles of justice, the things that we think of as &#8220;ours&#8221;&#8212;our innate skills and those we develop through education and commitment&#8212;do not entitle us to the benefits of deploying them in our political economy. Instead, our personal endowments and the value that society puts on them are morally arbitrary. From the moral view of this &#8220;original position&#8221;, choosing the principles used to guide the distribution of the benefits that accrue from exercising these should be a political decision that we make together. Yet, imagining that we might be a seamstress, a basketball player, or unemployable, each of us reasons the same way. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Brooke Ackerly is Assistant Professor at Vandervilt University (brooke.ackerly@vanderbilt.edu).

When such division obstructs cooperation, women lose their most effective advocates in the public sphere. How can movements overcome these divisions and improve their influence on policy and society? In some contexts, it seems that activists are able to overcome such divisions without denying politically salient conflicts. The transnational movement against gender violence, for example, mobilizes people not only across differences of race, class and sexuality but also across differences of language, national context, level of development, and the like. How do they do this? I argue that the movement against gender violence has achieved cooperation through the development of norms of inclusivity. Such norms include a commitment to descriptive representation, the facilitation of separate organization for disadvantaged social groups, and a commitment to building consensus with institutionalized dissent. Developing such norms is not the only possible path to cooperation, but it is an important and overlooked one. It illuminates a way of maintaining solidarity and improving policy influence without denying or sublimating the differences and conflicts among activists. Existing scholarship on social movements that attributes successful cooperation to shared interests, identities, or opportunities, is incomplete because it does not take account of relations of domination among activists who cooperate. Attending to the context of structural inequality in which social movements operate improves our understanding of social mobilization and illuminates overlooked paths to cooperation. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706060063","55-74","S.

The disappointing experience of mineral-rich countries has generated a large body of scholarship aimed at explaining this empirical correlation and a list of prescriptions for combating the resource curse. The most popular solutions emphasize macroeconomic policies, economic diversification, natural resource funds, transparency and accountability, and direct distribution to the general population. The success of these solutions has been limited because they either presuppose strong state institutions, which are widely absent in the developing world, or assume state ownership over mineral wealth and thus the need for external actors to constrain the state. At the same time, domestic private ownership is rarely proposed and often maligned. Yet, in some countries, it would serve as a more viable way to avoid the resource curse by fostering institutions that more effectively constrain state leaders, encouraging them to invest in institution building, and enabling them to respond more successfully to commodity booms and busts. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706060051","35-53","and Pauline Jones Luong","Brown University (<a href=mailto:pauline_luong@brown.edu>pauline_luong@brown.edu)","Erika Weinthal","Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences at Duke University (<a href=mailto:weinthal@duke.edu>weinthal@duke.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","10196","3297"

What intrigued us was a vast literature, grounded in neo-Marxism and covering huge swaths of history and geography. Nearly all the important books and articles were by sociologists and historians, but with StructureandChangeinEconomicHistory, my then-colleague, economist Douglass North, transformed the debate by using economic models of transaction costs and property rights to model the state's role in economic prosperity over time.

Some of these studies directly address the incentives and constraints that public opinion places in the path of democratic leadership. Others analyze the manner in which actors within the higher echelons of the power structure interact to produce national policies.

Why Constitutional Government Requires Sovereign States","LawWithoutNations?WhyConstitutionalGovernmentRequiresSovereignStates. By Jeremy A. Rabkin.

Defenders of American foreign policy argue that these institutions just do not serve America's interest. Jeremy Rabkin offers an alternative version of this argument: He says that yielding sovereignty to global institutions violates America's constitutional traditions, and the attractive mixture of freedom and security that these traditions support. Global governance is bureaucratic, insensitive to democratic pressures, and indifferent to local variation in values and interests. Further, liberty requires the rule of law, and the rule of law can prevail only in a sovereign state. Global governance undermines sovereignty and thus undermines the rule of law and freedom as well.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706750277","432-433","Eric Posner","University of Chicago","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","582","138"

David Held and Mathias Koenig-Archibugi have assembled essays on the topic by a high-powered stable of scholars. Michael Cox, one of the most prolific and penetrating analysts of American power today, kicks off the volume with a learned tourd'horizon of scholarly debates on whether empire is a useful concept to apply today, whether the United States is one, and whether its primacy will endure. Michael Mann and Mary Kaldor present skeptical views on the latter issue. Mann briskly makes his case that as strong as it is militarily, the United States lacks the other wellsprings of power any self-respecting empire needs. And Kaldor goes on to disparage the real utility of the one kind of power that everyone in the book agrees the United States possesses in abundance. High-technology military force, she argues, &#8220;rarely confers a decisive advantage in conflicts between armed opponents&#8221; (p. 187).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706740270","431-432","William C.

Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2005. 282p. $22.95.The central thesis of this book is that the unresolved issue fueling the continued divisiveness of the Vietnam War is the key legacy of the unaccounted-for remains of America's missing in action (MIAs) in Indochina. It is a thesis that Thomas Hawley propounds at several levels. His argument is empirical in its depiction of the investigative processes and results of the actual searches for these men. It is semiotic in its focus on the symbol of their bodies as &#8220;signing&#8221; for the larger issues still surrounding the war. It is an investigation into the impact on the American popular and political culture of these bodies&#8212;those of the visible veterans and of the invisible, fragmented missing soldiers&#8212;in terms of how they are depicted in the arts (Hollywood mostly) and in memorials. Finally, it aspires to a more profound philosophical level in assessing the moral and political implications of this thesis for our larger understanding of the Vietnam War itself.

However, students of the global political economy of the environment have lacked a comprehensive and accessible text until the publication of this book. Furthermore, many chapters on this subject in textbooks have narrowed the field to discussion of regime formation and the salience of institutional structures. While Jennifer Clapp and Peter Dauvergne recognize the importance of institutional arrangements, their focus is on the intersection between economic process and environmental problems. The book consists essentially of three main sections. The first section provides the theoretical framework, the second investigates the relationship between globalization and the environment, and the final section provides a number of case studies of the political economy of environmental change.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706690270","425-426","Marc Williams","University of New South Wales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","856","234"

London: Routledge, 2004. 324p. $125.00 cloth, $34.95 paper.What do a French-educated Algerian revolutionary, a Lakota traditionalist, Kim Dae Jung, a Romanian sex worker in Cyprus, a Guyanese cricket star of South Asian origin and his Afro-Guyanese fans, a Muslim living in Europe, a Tibetan nationalist, a child rug maker in India, and Aung San Suu Kyi have in common? Mainstream theorists of international relations would say: nothing. According to Geeta Chowdhry and Sheila Nair, however, the members of this unlikely crowd expose the incapacity of IR to explain or usefully contribute to some of the most important debates taking place within and between countries and regions. The stories they compile also reveal the complicity of IR in the justification and reproduction of the class, race, and gender inequalities constitutive of European and U.S. domination from the fifteenth century to today. Power,PostcolonialismandInternationalRelations argues that although the last decade has seen much criticism of the ahistorical gender- and race-neutral rational actor model that dominates IR scholarship, its critics have neither adequately explained why this model persists nor analyzed its effects on both the participants in and the objects of international conflicts.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706680274","424-425","Karen M.

By William A. Callahan. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004. 297p. $68.95 cloth, $22.95 paper.International relations scholarship has moved beyond debates between realists and liberals, yet much of the literature on the growth of Chinese power, or on China's regional and global interests, reflects theories of balance of power or peace through trade and engagement. Many of the most popular and well-known works on China (for example, Richard Bernstein and Ross H. Munro's 1998 book TheComingConflictwithChina) view the economic success and modernization of China as a threat to U.S. interests and to the larger international order. William Callahan's ContingentStates not only avoids this standard refrain but actively rejects and criticizes it. Callahan accomplishes two important goals in his book. First, he shows how conventional international relations paradigms can mislead us about the &#8220;true&#8221; aims of Chinese foreign policy; and secondly, he uses &#8220;Greater China&#8221; as a theoretical framework to examine four issues in Asia: the South China Sea dispute, Sino-Korean relations, the return of Hong Kong, and cross-straits relations between China and Taiwan. In addition to an introduction, theoretical chapter, and conclusion, one chapter is devoted to each of these issues.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706670278","423-424","Amy L.

More than a few overly optimistic liberals like Thomas Friedman in TheLexusandtheOliveTree (2000) have made just such a claim. But the world is hardly such a simple place, as we learn in Stephen Brooks's carefully crafted book. Brooks begins by unpacking the multifaceted nature of economic globalization itself, and through the main body of the book he closely examines how individual threads of this phenomenon may pull some nations toward more pacific relations while tugging others in more dangerous directions. A great deal of case-based and anecdotal evidence is marshaled along the way, and some of his arguments are made more convincingly than others. But in the end, he has given us a clear, comprehensive, and forward-looking treatment of a question that has heretofore been dismissed with oversimplified answers.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706650275","420-421","Brian M.

By Erik Wibbels. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 276p. $85.00.In this book, Erik Wibbels explores the &#8220;federal collective action problem&#8221; (pp. 47, 62). Because in federal countries national and regional leaders answer to different constituencies, their electoral interests and preferences toward socially costly reforms might conflict. Market economic reforms constitute one type of such measures. As Wibbels argues, in crisis-ridden federations, &#8220;economic reforms takes [sic] on the quality of a public good requiring the individual regions to cooperate, whereas it is more rational for each career-oriented politician to avoid the costs associated with austerity&#8221; (p. 27). National leaders concerned with macroeconomic stability want market economic reforms implemented in the regions, but regional leaders have an incentive to free-ride and adopt fiscally expansionary policies. The book suggests that &#8220;many market reform policies are a function of a constant process of bargaining between national and regional leaders struggling for political survival&#8221; (p. 5). Moreover, it argues that &#8220;[t]he degree to which the two sets of actors [national and regional leaders] conflict depends on four crucial factors: the electoral interests that each brings to the game, a shared intergovernmental fiscal system, the manner in which regional interests are represented in national policy making, and the levers of partisan influence national leaders have over subnational politicians&#8221; (pp. 5&#8211;6). The author proposes that fiscally autonomous regions with competitive party systems are more likely to converge with the national government's interests on market economic reforms; and that national electoral coattails are a more effective means for disciplining regional leaders than partisan harmony through centrally dispensed carrots and sticks (pp. 38&#8211;39).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706600273","414-415","Tulia G.

By Georg Vanberg. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 208p. $70.00.The judicial power to review the constitutionality of laws was a unique feature of American constitutionalism well into the twentieth century. The perceived success of this experiment in limited democracy prompted several nations, among them West Germany, to create courts of constitutional review in the aftermath of World War II. Now several decades later, as the author of this book writes, constitutional review &#8220;has emerged as an almost universal feature of western-style democracy&#8221; (p. 1). In most of the world's advanced liberal democracies, the power to review the constitutionality of laws has been lodged in specialized courts of constitutional review, meaning that only these courts are empowered to nullify laws on constitutional grounds. Germany's Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) is one of the most notable and powerful of these specialized tribunals. It is notable for the frequency with which it has invalidated national and local laws and also for the extensive reach of its jurisdiction. Owing to the German court's rejection of any political question doctrine, together with its authority to decide with finality abstract questions of constitutional law&#8212;that is, questions raised by legislators outside the normal framework of an actual law suit&#8212;its powers of review actually exceed those of the Supreme Court. Indeed, the FCC has begun to challenge the Supreme Court as the leading model of constitutional review around the world.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706590279","413-414","Donald P.

In RadicalIslamRising, Quintan Wiktorowicz asks why rational individuals would join a high-risk organization such as al-Muhajiroun, a radical Islamist movement based in the UK. Joining entails high risk because members are &#8220;targets of stigma, harassment, retaliation, and even more extreme sanctions such as loss of a job, injury, or death&#8221; (p. 206; also pp. 45&#8211;77).

The countries studied are mainly in Western Europe but also include Israel, Canada, and the United States. Authors address a common set of questions within the context of each country, shaped by an initial conceptual examination of what constitutes presidentialization. This is distinguished from the simple existence of a presidential or semipresidential constitutional regime. While both favor presidentialism, in the sense of the power and autonomy of the head of government, this can fluctuate over time, as it can within the classic parliamentary systems. This distinction between presidentialization as a process and the constitutional provisions for a presidential or parliamentary system is a useful feature of the book. Given the potential confusion between these regime types and the dynamic process that is the book's focus, it is perhaps unfortunate that another name could not have been found for the processes favoring executive autonomy and power. However, given that popular and journalistic discussions have already found a name for them, it is perhaps inevitable that they should be termed presidentialization in spite of the potential ambiguities of the term.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706550273","407-408","Ian Budge","University of Essex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1092","273"

They endure even in the face of challenges that, in the region's past, have spelled democratic ruin. These include financial and economic crises, coup attempts, and persistent political and/or criminal violence. But if democracies stand, presidents fail with noticeable frequency. In the last 18 years, chief executives have resigned or been removed from office&#8212;without suspension of democratic rule&#8212;in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, and Venezuela. Interrupted presidencies, to borrow Arturo Valenzuela's apposite description, may well become one of three interlinked regional democratic markers. The second potential marker is the ascendance of political outsiders and the return of outcasts: Obscure, improbable, and discredited candidates (re)emerge as viable, even formidable, electoral contenders. The third, though seemingly at odds with the other two, is in fact closely related: citizenries that waver between disenchantment and bitterness, apathy and mobilization.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706530270","404-406","Consuelo Cruz","Tufts University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","762","307"

In 2004, Freedom House even moved Russia from the &#8220;partly free&#8221; to &#8220;not free&#8221; list of states. Russia's democratic shortcomings are legion and well known: corruption, human rights abuses, electoral manipulation, use of the courts to silence regime opponents, and state control over the media.

Together with an impressive team of contributors, Gary Segura and Shaun Bowler set out to examine how minority Americans&#8212;blacks and Latinos, in particular&#8212;engage with the democratic political process, from how they align themselves within the existing party system to how they use the tools of democratic citizenship (namely, the vote) to advance their interests. In many ways Segura, Bowler, and their colleagues succeed and, in the process, reveal a number of important empirical phenomena and relationships, such as the value of descriptive representation in promoting both political trust and participation. Because of its contribution to basic knowledge about minority political behavior, this book would certainly be a valuable addition to any minority politics syllabus.

Kent Patel and Mark Rushefsky's survey of the politics of American public health argues that our system emphasizes curative treatment of existing illnesses at the expense of activities aimed at preventing them. Although the United States spends more per capita on health care than any other country, public health activities account for only about 2% to 3% of such expenditures. The low priority given public health, they argue, accounts for America's poor performance relative to other industrialized countries on measures of life expectancy and infant mortality.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706480270","396-397","Richard Himelfarb","Hofstra University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","588","97"

By Laura R. Olson, Sue E. S. Crawford, and Melissa M. Deckman. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2005. 190p. $37.50.This book explores the role of women clergy in mainline Protestant churches and the rabbinate. It is based largely on 54 in-depth interviews conducted in 1998 in four U.S. cities (Indianapolis, Omaha, Milwaukee, and Washington, DC), but also includes considerable material from a much larger national survey of clergy. The authors are most interested in the &#8220;political&#8221; role of their subjects and in how their gender affects this role. They themselves define &#8220;politics&#8221; very broadly, as &#8220;actions taken to influence collective decision-making processes concerning resource distribution or the development and enforcement of shared values&#8221; (p. 14). But they do not impose this definition on their subjects. Instead, the clergywomen are asked about the issues and concerns that motivate them, what kinds of activities they consider most appropriate or helpful to address those concerns, and what their own involvement has been in such activities. In both the interviews and the national survey, around a third of the women indicated that gender &#8220;in some way&#8221; limited her ability to participate in politics. Three-quarters of the interviewees volunteered gender as a factor (either an asset or a liability) for political activity, or as a reason why particular issues were especially salient to them. But few mentioned either their denomination or its women's caucuses as a factor linking their gender with political involvement.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706470274","395-396","Susan B.

Edited by James Morone and Lawrence Jacobs. New York: Oxford University Press, 382p. $29.95.The result of the United States system for providing health insurance and care is that some citizens receive an abundance of high-quality care while others receive care that is poor, hard to come by, or both. This state of affairs does not fairly reflect public opinion; when surveyed, the majority of citizens express support for the idea that access to care is a right of citizenship. In a nation in which public policies relate strongly to public opinions, the failure to solve the health insurance problem is puzzling. Some analysts describe the health policy problem as economic: Health insurance products, the nature of health care as a good, and the hegemonic roles of providers and payers combine to produce the distribution of health benefits that now exists. The editors and contributors in this volume reject that view and describe health inequality as a political problem solvable with political solutions.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706460278","393-394","Charles Barrilleaux","Florida State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","451","67"

Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005. 391p. $29.95.Robert Wuthnow's latest book is a wide-ranging and insightful study into how Americans are responding to dramatic increases in religious and cultural diversity. Wuthnow gives particular attention here to the ways in which Christians are addressing (or ignoring) the growing populations of Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and other followers of non-Western religions in America. His aim is not only to understand the current terms by which American Christians are negotiating an increasingly complex and diverse religious setting but also to pointedly ask how pluralistic Americans are willing to be. The answers that are revealed throughout this book, drawing from hundreds of in-depth interviews and a large cross-national survey, offer plenty of room for deep worry as well as guarded optimism. Moving beyond these caged responses, Wuthnow pulls together the ambivalent stands of America's present attitudes toward religious differences and offers suggestive ideas about how Americans might begin to move beyond their currently shallow responses to diversity and embrace a more active, self-conscious form of pluralism, what he calls &#8220;reflective pluralism&#8221; (p. 289).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706450271","391-393","Mark E.

Conceived in a conference to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Madison's birth, this volume is written by public choice theorists, the latest group of political scientists who claim to be Madison's heirs. In particular, the authors explore his understanding of the relationship of institutional design to policy outcomes and his insights into the use of interests and incentives to influence the behavior of politicians, groups, and ordinary citizens. They also examine his observations about free-riding, collective action, the delegation of authority from citizens to representatives, and the problems of &#8220;agency&#8221; responsibility and loss that result from delegation.

It was clear, however, that his views had important implications for politics and political theory (no more so than in the superb essay &#8220;The Idea of Equality,&#8221; the one earlier essay reprinted in this collection). And beginning in the eighties, perhaps influenced by his friendship with Isaiah Berlin and the influence of the latter upon his thinking, Williams focused his thinking increasingly both on quite practical politics and on major issues in political theory. His interest in moral questions never waned, but his reflections concerning them almost always made connections to political and/or political theoretical issues.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706320270","375-376","Richard E.

Vetter explores this metaphor in four texts: the Odyssey,Lysistrata,Statesman, and Phaedo. She finds in the metaphor a &#8220;dialectical foundationalism&#8221; that mediates between subjectivity and objectivity, reason and emotion, action and deliberation (p. 7). Weaving incorporates complexity, creating a new whole without destroying the particularities that comprise it. This form of weaving she values, but it appears only in the Socrates speech in the Phaedo and the construction of Plato's dialogue.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706290273","371-372","Arlene W.

By Brian Z. Tamanaha. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 188p. $75.00 cloth, $29.99 paper.Brian Z. Tamanaha reminds us that the rule of law is a near-universal yet little-understood ideal. His book presents a brief and clear introductory history and analysis that defends the coherence and value of the rule of law and that gives a sense of its global reach, limitations, and prospects. Tamanaha wisely argues that what is called the rule of law is actually a family of doctrines. Crucial to it, on his view, are three &#8220;themes&#8221; (p. 114): government limited by law, formal legality (which &#8220;entails public, prospective rules with the qualities of generality, equality of application, and certainty&#8221; [p. 119]), and a distinction between the rule of law and the &#8220;rule of man&#8221; (p. 122). The theoretical core of the book deftly explicates Friedrich Hayek's defenses and Roberto Unger's criticisms of legal liberalism as a prelude to discussing the challenges of indeterminacy and surveying a range of thinner to thicker formal and substantive conceptions of the rule of law. Tamanaha analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of each of these conceptions. These analyses are intelligent and fair-minded; his own position is veiled, but suggests support for a relatively thin substantive and relatively thick formal conception (involving basic individual rights within a formally democratic legal order), friendly to Hayek and not too bothered by the acknowledged indeterminacy of legal rules.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706280277","370-371","Stephen G.

His crucial distinction echoes that of Isaiah Berlin's (1969) FourEssaysonLiberty: Negative freedom (which Schwarz calls &#8220;free-market freedom&#8221;) involves the absence of formal restrictions on personal conduct, particularly those coming from government, whereas positive freedom (&#8220;genuine freedom,&#8221; in Schwarz's words) requires that society be organized such that people can and do attain a decent standard of living through their own efforts. Schwarz differs from Berlin, however, in seeing positive freedom not as a concept easily twisted for totalitarian ends but rather as the highest form of freedom. Emphasizing only negative freedom means ignoring the bonds that connect citizens to one another, leading to an individualistic, morally bankrupt notion that says we are all in this&#8212;alone.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706270270","369-370","Mark Smith","University of Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","534","62"

By Keally D. McBride. University Park: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2005. 192p. $45.00.The concept of community weighs heavily in the history of social and political theory but even more so in the collective imagination. The idea and varying visions of community traverse concepts of identity, public sphere, and state in theoretical discourses. Community also insinuates itself into discussions and decision making at the most practical level. Keally D. McBride's book offers a creative and probing exploration of how community has been imagined by theorists and how imagined communities inform practice. It does not claim to be a comprehensive synthesis of competing views, but rather succeeds as a provocative set of thematically linked, exploratory essays. While McBride acknowledges at the outset the importance of the analytic task of delineating the various conceptualizations of community, her project makes its contribution by explicating how visions of the political imagination of different eras inform the imagination of community. She shows how the resulting set of ideals and images creates and constrains real-world political possibilities. Throughout, she offers subtle judgments and useful provocations and, in the end, this book emerges as an important resource for everyone who values the possibilities of community, but wishes to remain critical of the concept's many traps and seductions.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706260274","368-369","Keith Fitzgerald","New College of Florida","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","643","98"

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 400p. $75.00 cloth, $29.99 paper.This is a fascinating book about constitutional development in the United States that questions traditional explanations for the genesis of constitutional rights. In this erudite study, Ken Kersch offers an account of the changing interpretations of constitutional rights by analyzing landmark cases in their historical context in order to show the interplay of ideological, political, and social forces that influenced them. The book provides a careful reconsideration of the jurisprudence concerning civil rights and civil liberties that effectively challenges the conventional wisdom about individual cases. Kersch's compelling analysis demonstrates that explanations for the expansion of particular rights are often more complicated than traditional constitutional works have assumed. He argues that the expansion of constitutional rights did not occur in a unilinear and unidimensional fashion (cf, e.g., pp. 132, 360). This is a brilliant interdisciplinary study that should interest scholars in many fields, including cultural studies, history, international law, law and society, and political science.

Do they conflict? Do they empower or instead disempower the weak and oppressed? What is their fate in an era of globalization? The key to answering these questions may lie more in historical than conceptual investigation. This is the hunch that inspires Micheline Ishay's remarkably learned and wide-ranging book. It delivers forceful conclusions, which need no belaboring by the author, since she allows them to emerge from the historical record. Among the lessons we learn are that human rights should indeed be viewed as universal; that they draw nourishment from diverse ideological sources; that their meaning has always been contested, though not primarily along cultural lines; that civil and political rights on the one hand and socioeconomic rights on the other have historically been dependent on each other; that the claim to national self-determination as a human right has often been a cover for human rights violations; and that the idea of human rights has regularly been reborn, often strengthened, after periods of tyranny and oppression.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706240271","365-366","Jamie Mayerfeld","University of Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1187","361"

Dubious sweeping neurological claims have displaced what are regarded as dubious &#8220;talking cure&#8221; claims. This cultural trend is reflected in the reflex-like skepticism with which especially under-50 scholars behold the works of Sigmund Freud and his schismatic followers. Political scientists rarely bother with psychoanalysis or tend at best to exhibit a &#8220;Freud for Beginners' grasp of the enterprise, which is, after all, an exploration, and canny effort at explanation, of our &#8220;inner world&#8221; and of the rule of unconscious elements over our intentions and best-laid plans. Inasmuch as the study of the unwieldy &#8220;inner self&#8221; militates against rational modeling, it is little wonder that psychoanalysis has fallen out of favor since Harold Lasswell's heyday.

In thinking about welfare states, economists have traditionally been interested in their effects on the distribution of income and, above all, their implications for efficiency and growth. Alesina and Glaeser instead set out to explain why &#8220;Americans are much less willing to redistribute from the rich to the poor than Europeans&#8221; (2) or, in other words, why the American welfare state is so small by comparison to European welfare states. This, then, is a book about American exceptionalism in the realm of social policy, but Alesina and Glaeser's discussion also addresses the general problem of accounting for cross-national variation in the public provision of social welfare. Their project is to provide an account of the exceptional nature of the American welfare state that is consistent with and sheds light on differences among other welfare states as well.

In 2000 (the latest year for which migration data are available on a global basis) the United States was home to almost 35 million legal and unauthorized migrants, or 2.7 times as many as any other country. Although other nations have higher proportions of foreign-born residents (e.g., nearly 25 percent in Australia and 20 percent in Canada), the globally dominant position of the United States in regard to numbers of new immigrants reinforces its self-image as a &#8220;nation of immigrants,&#8221; as does the fact that immigration is generally seen as contributing to the country's economic and demographic strength. However, over the past three decades, more and more new arrivals with non-European origins have come to the country (more than four-fifths are Latino and Asian), many with very low levels of education and illegal status at entry. These changes have fueled public concerns and led to heated debates over whether U.S. admissions and settlement-related policies ought to be modified. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Frank D.

The values, says he, made America great, unified the country, and allowed immigrant upward mobility through assimilation and acculturation. Huntington expresses concern that immigrants from Latin America, now our main newcomers, along with their U.S.-born progeny, are creating another America, culturally and socially distinct. The reason for this, he claims, is that they settle in close proximity to one another; they retain use of their mother tongue, Spanish; and they remain, in the main, committed Catholics. These conditions purportedly are bad both for America and for the immigrants. They impede new immigrant ability to live the American Dream and, by implication, America's continued global economic preeminence. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Susan Eckstein is Professor of Sociology at Boston University (seckstei@bu.edu).

At the heart of his difficulties is a widely shared form of reasoning about racial and ethnic populations that has become increasingly problematic in the contemporary era of mass immigration: it anticipates a single, predominant outcome for group members, such as assimilation or racialized exclusion; instead, it is the diversity within groups of patterns of incorporation into American society that needs recognition today. This is all the more true of Mexican Americans because of the long history across which their immigration stretches and their presence in the Southwest and California before the arrival of European Americans. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Richard Alba is Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Public Policy at The University at Albany, SUNY (r.alba@albany.edu).

The innovation resides mainly in the correlation between a prominent strand in Western social and political thought&#8212;the Frankfurt School program of &#8220;critical theory&#8221;&#8212;and a major phenomenon of contemporary political life: the process of globalization. In many ways, this correlation goes against the dominant academic grain. At least as cultivated in American academia, political theory tends to be mainly retrospective and concerned with the rehearsal of time-honored texts, often with a pronounced slant against contaminating theorizing with mundane affairs. On the other hand, examination of current developments&#8212;including the process of globalization&#8212;tends to be left to journalists or else to specialists in international politics with little or no background in traditions of political thought. In this respect, the present volume is a breakthrough. It deliberately seeks to bring the insights of the Frankfurt School program to bear on ongoing discussions about global politics, economics, science, and aesthetics.

Political scientists who research genocide, ethnic conflict, civil war, humanitarianism, and African politics all have taken interest in the region, and Darfur is likely to command scholarly attention in years to come. Yet the academic literature on the region remains thin. To date, scholars have relied primarily on journalistic accounts and human rights reports, which detail the violence but, by their nature, provide only cursory historical background. With the publication of these two short but informative books, Darfur's political history and the path to mass violence are substantially clearer.

John Campbell details the shortcomings of institutionalist theory in the face of institutional change, using the empirical case of globalization for largely illustrative purposes. Michael Barnett and Martha Finnemore aim to put the &#8220;organization&#8221; back into the study of international organizations, using three case studies to locate the roots of mission creep not in the demands of states but in the bureaucratic cultures of organizations themselves.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005, 304p. $99.00 cloth.In the late 1990s, the World Bank conducted a far-reaching research program on the causes of civil war. Were civil wars inspired mainly by genuine unresolved political grievances, or were they precipitated by predatory groups (including governments) seeking to profit monetarily from violence and instability? Among the bank's myriad findings, many of them hotly disputed, came one assertion around which there was almost universal consensus: that the single factor that made future conflict likely was past conflict concluded within the previous five years. This finding, based on exhaustive empirical research, has two profound consequences for thinkers and practitioners engaged in formulating and assessing the transition from war to peace. On the one hand, it shows that the risks and costs of failure are high. Failure to foster political reconciliation, to tackle the root causes of conflict, to rebuild shattered economies and (among other things) provide a secure environment is more likely to lead to the outbreak of war and oppression than any other factor. On the other hand, the World Bank findings show that&#8212;contra some skeptics who argue that third parties have no part to play and that political conflicts are best resolved violently&#8212;long-term success need not be a chimera: Build peace effectively for over five years and the chances of future conflict decrease dramatically.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. 239p. $85.00.As all students of contemporary European politics know, the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 specified a series of criteria that member states of the European Union had to fulfill in order to join the single currency that would be launched in 1998&#8211;99. Most importantly, public debt had to be less than 60% of the GDP and government deficits were not to exceed 3% of GDP. When decisions on initial membership of the Eurozone were taken in 1998, the debt criterion was relaxed, but the deficit criterion was strictly enforced, and as result, Greek membership was postponed for several years. The Stability and Growth Pact adopted by the European Council in 1997, in turn, introduced a procedure whereby the European Commission would monitor the fiscal policies of Eurozone members and would be required to propose sanctions against states with persistent government deficits in excess of 3% of GDP. During 2002&#8211;4, the European Commission found Portugal, France, and Germany in violation of the Stability and Growth Pact, but the Council of Ministers declined to impose sanctions on any of these countries.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270664036X","619-620","Jonas Pontusson","Princeton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","550","126"

By David Ost. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2005. 238p. $39.95.&#8220;Whatever happened to Solidarity?&#8221; is an often heard question, echoing the passivity of organized labor during the transition to capitalism throughout Eastern Europe. The position of the working class is especially puzzling in view of Solidarity's role in bringing down communist power in Poland and beyond. Yet the mighty force of the 1980s became a shadow of itself during the construction of markets and democracy, losing members' loyalty, organizational power, and political influence as the country embraced the ideology of neoliberalism. David Ost offers a powerful and original answer to the question of Solidarity's demise, one that goes beyond the oft-repeated claims about economic and social dislocation rendering the working class the &#8220;losers&#8221; in the postcommunist reconstruction. Rather than adhering solely to structural explanations, Ost focuses on political agency as determining the fate of the working class. His bold, persuasive assertion is that workers were abandoned by intellectual allies and union leaders. The new Polish elite embraced a radical vision of the liberal, capitalist future that left little room for accommodation with the working class. Even worse, by overlooking the interests of labor, the liberal establishment pushed the workers to channel their resentment in a populist direction, ultimately embracing the ideology and political parties of the nationalist Right (pp. 66, 95&#8211;96).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706630363","617-619","Jack Bielasiak","Indiana University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","548","118"

Given the complexity and dynamism in China's economy, Kennedy makes the astute observation that no single model suffices to describe the complex business&#8211;government relations in China.

To his credit, the author avoids the usual trap of characterizing welfare reform exclusively in terms of retrenchment. Recognizing the complex nature of shifts in social policy over time, his work details and explains patterns of retrenchment, restructuring, and expansion. To understand the pathways of policy transformation, he considers three types of explanatory factors: party politics (mainly actors' preferences), contextual conditions (such as major events and social trends), and institutional parameters (including legal constraints, existing policy programs, and the characteristics of political economy structures).

How do certain patterns of institutions affect the chances of democratic survival? And his theoretical framework, in its initial formulation, makes two claims. First, institutional choices are a product of powerful agents pursuing their narrow interest. If you know who is powerful and what they want, you will be able to predict the institutional outcomes. Second, the key to democratic survival, at least in the initial posttransition phase, is the breadth and strength of the original institution-forming coalition. A key conclusion of the study is that democracies are in trouble when the coalitions that brought about their institutional arrangements lose power too soon, as happened in prewar Poland and in Weimar Germany. And this can occur for a variety of reasons: New actors may be brought in, for example, or the salient issues may change.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706550364","608-610","Karol Soltan","University of Maryland at College Park","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","445","78"

In Williams's view, if we try to build Native American policy from the racist materials of the past, we will inevitably build racism into Indian law of the future. Ultimately, we must therefore recognize that racism lies at the foundation of the American legal system. To many, this message is a bitter pill.

Drawing on their exhaustive collection of policy data for the last three decades, Bryan Jones and Frank Baumgartner make a very persuasive argument for their &#8220;punctuated equilibrium&#8221; theory of public policy. The authors detail a catalog of reasons why policy changes are typically small, including (among other things) individual-level &#8220;bounded rationality&#8221; and institutional properties like &#8220;friction.&#8221; These many factors combine to produce policy that appears to change incrementally most of the time, but there are infrequent moments in which major change is observed. The amount of nonincremental change is linked to the nature of political institutions and to the stages of the policy process. The final stage of the process&#8212;legislative change&#8212;is costly and slow, producing infrequent change, while changes in the earlier stages are less costly and therefore more frequent.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706470365","598-599","Paul E.

Gutterman shows that whereas the movements of Billy Sunday and the Promise Keepers are essentially antidemocratic (and also &#8220;antipolitical&#8221;) in nature, the examples of Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Call to Renewal demonstrate that religious social movements can enhance pluralism, mutual respect, and dialogue in American politics.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706440366","594-595","James R.

By Joanne H. Wright. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004. 260p. $50.00.The author's express purpose in this book is &#8220;to cast a critical eye on the origins motif as it surfaces in the tradition of political thought&#8221; (p. 23). &#8220;Political origin stories,&#8221; Joanne Wright tells us, &#8220;are narratives about the beginnings of politics and power&#8221; (p. 3). Origin narratives may be used to consolidate existing or threatened political arrangements, or to inspire radical efforts to reconfigure the prevailing terms of political identity and civic consociation. The crucial thing to note about origin stories is that they function as foundational narratives, effectively setting uncontested and quasi-ontological terms for political identity, aspiration, and legitimacy. In short, though politically motivated, origin stories are perversely antipolitical, in the sense that they &#8220;confer upon politics the permanence of nature&#8221; (p. 10). Origin stories have a number of other troubling aspects and effects, including &#8220;their manipulation of history, their naturalization of conventional political relations, and their function as justificatory scripts of citizenship&#8221; (p. 22). The myth of the metals from Plato's Republic offers an exemplary case of the origin story: &#8220;the autochthonous myth of the metals justifies and elicits consent to a hierarchical ordering of classes in the republic&#8221; (p. 4).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706370363","584-585","Christine Di Stefano","University of Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","812","101"

By Charles Tilly. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 214p. $55.00 cloth, $19.99 paper.From his earliest publications, Charles Tilly has focused on the relationships between varying sets of agents in civil society, forms of rule, and state formation. Democracy, and the circumstances under which it arises or disintegrates, has been an important aspect of these inquiries. Tilly's fullest, recent examination of these issues is his (2003) ContentionandDemocracyinEurope,1650&#8211;2000. There, he argued that what was crucial for democratization over the long period was the insulation of public politics from &#8220;categorical inequalities&#8221; of class, race, gender and the like; the transformation of public politics in ways that broadened and equalized participation, enhanced collective control of government, and inhibited arbitrary conduct by political actors; and the integration of &#8220;trust networks&#8221; into public politics. TrustandRule elaborates the conceptual and historical arguments for this last &#8220;necessary&#8221; condition for democratization. In doing so the author jousts briefly (but persuasively) with the recent debate over &#8220;trust,&#8221; social capital, and democracy. He then recasts that debate in the light of older literatures in social history, sociology, and institutional economics on networks as a means of collective action in the presence of various forms of rule, not only democracy.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706340364","580-582","Ian Bell","Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office, Australia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","543","150"

By Tommie Shelby. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005. 336p. $27.95.The intellectual and strategic moorings of contemporary black political solidarity are increasingly unstable. As the political memory of the race-specific Civil Rights movement fades further into history, intraracial differences that have always existed, such as gender, religion, sexuality, multiracial identification, immigration, region, cultural affiliation, political ideology, and generation, are being highlighted by race scholars from a variety of fields as reasons for rethinking race-based political cohesion. Tommie Shelby acknowledges all of these internal pressures, but sees the widening gap between poor and more affluent blacks as the intraracial fissure that most threatens political cohesion among today's African Americans. From this sociological premise, Shelby sets out to articulate a &#8220;progressive,&#8221; philosophically sound basis for black political organization that appeals both to the class interests of poor and working-class blacks and to those of middle- and upper-class blacks. By &#8220;progressive,&#8221; Shelby means a recognition that basic social injustices linger, and can and should be corrected through state intervention and/or collective political action. Remedies for current racial inequalities cannot be found in a &#8220;conservative&#8221; return to a former era of ostensibly better social organization.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706320361","578-579","Hawley Fogg-Davis","Temple University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","693","91"

By Jennifer Pitts. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005. 392p. $39.50.This book is a brilliantly successful attempt to account for the apparent transition from the fierce, bitter assault on the idea of empire by the writers of the second half of the eighteenth century&#8212;from Montesquieu and Adam Smith to Benjamin Constant&#8212;to the often self-congratulatory, high-minded endorsement of a new kind of imperial mission less than half a century later, here associated most clearly with the writings of John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville. To have identified this shift in the first place is not the least of Jennifer Pitts's merits. Much of the modern, postcolonial historiography of this period has assumed, generally without much argument, that it was the &#8220;Enlightenment&#8221; that provided the ideological inspiration for the evolution of the nineteenth-century European empires. True, Pitts has been greatly assisted by two previous works, Sankar Muthu's EnlightenmentagainstEmpire (2003) and Uday Mehta's LiberalismandEmpire (1999), but although these have done much to establish the existence of an antiimperial Enlightenment, neither has anything much to say about the transformation in European imperial policy, and in European political theory, that followed the end of the French Revolution.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706300369","574-576","Anthony Pagden","University of California, Los Angeles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","655","164"

By Alice Ormiston. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2004. 164p. $40.00With this book, Alice Ormiston presents a compelling interpretation of Hegel's philosophy that speaks to the needs of our time. Her central argument is that love is &#8220;the continuous foundation at play in Hegel's understanding of the modern self&#8221; and the &#8220;experiential basis&#8221; of his philosophy (pp. 5&#8211;6). Hegelian love is an expansive notion that has historical grounding in early Christian mysticism. No longer readily felt in widely shared religious or civic practices, love has been all but eclipsed in the modern world. But love's knowledge is not lost. Reappearing as a moment of grace in situations of moral and political conflict, love helps us heed our conscience. Hegel's political philosophy is, we learn, a call to conscience. If we do not know what conscience requires, we become vulnerable to &#8220;the problems of our time&#8221;: alienation and social atomism&#8212;seen in poverty, weakened commitments to family and local politics, and selfish disregard for the welfare of others&#8212;and a collective inability to distinguish right and wrong that contributes to evil (pp. 115&#8211;24).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706290364","573-574","Oona B.

By Josiah Ober. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005. 296p. $29.95.In the PhilosophyofHistory, Hegel says that the only thing anyone ever learns from history is that no one ever learns anything from history. Josiah Ober dissents. He believes that the study of ancient Greek history provides valuable lessons for maintaining democratic polities in today's world. AthenianLegacies is comprised of 10 essays&#8212;eight published previously, lightly revised. Ober is primarily a cultural historian. He describes this field as &#8220;concerned with functional explanation: how members of a society, or subgroups within a community, negotiated a set of meanings that allowed them to continue to live in an existing community&#8221; (p. 177). This volume can be read as a follow-up (one of several) to his important 1989 work, MassandEliteinDemocraticAthens. That study explores the role of discourse and ideology in alleviating conflict between richer and poorer citizens in ancient Athens and so contributing to democratic stability. In this new book as well, Ober's central concern is how products of public culture contributed to the reconciling of differences in Athenian identity, thus helping the Athenians &#8220;go on together.&#8221; The essays were written for different audiences: political theorists, classicists, moral philosophers. But the collection is more unified than many such works, as most essays bear to some degree on the central idea of &#8220;going on together.&#8221;<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706280368","572-573","George Klosko","University of Virginia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","505","61"

The founding act has often been drenched in blood because certain forms of violence actually help to foster political foundation. This is the illiberal starting point of Jesse Goldhammer's study of the French discourse on sacrificial violence, a theme that he rightly describes as &#8220;anathema to mainstream political theory&#8221; (p. x), which tends to divert its glance from what it sees as unseemly anachronisms like this. Undaunted, Goldhammer bravely plunges in, turning to 1790s France and the theorizing about sacrifice that it spawned for insight into the violence that he claims is &#8220;necessary for political beginnings&#8221; (p. 1). While the French revolutionaries engaged in &#8220;sacrificial practices and interpretations&#8221; such as the beheading of Louis XVI, they never actually developed a theory of sacrifice. That was the contribution of notorious postrevolutionary writers, such as Joseph de Maistre, Georges Sorel, and Georges Bataille, who well understood that violent sacrifice &#8220;facilitates the process of conferring moral legitimacy to political power and setting boundaries for political identity&#8221; (p. 192).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706230366","565-566","Graeme Garrard","Cardiff University, UK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","547","86"

This article draws on experiences with school reform to argue that ideas in the form of purposes play a part. Purposes, however, are erratic sources of motivation, sometimes generating intense commitments but often functioning in a mercurial manner. They operate in conjunction with the character and strength of supports. Purposes that are compatible in principle may nevertheless compete for time, resources, and especially attention. Because human beings are creatures of bounded rationality, any given purpose is susceptible to attention shift. Interpersonal and interorganizational networks can serve as counterweights by bolstering identity with the reform goal, providing cognitive reinforcement for it, and enhancing the credibility of a reform goal as achievable. In an assessment of the role of ideas, it is important to remember that they come in a variety of scopes and levels of abstractness. As forces in the politics of reform, ideas have a part shaped by context. The role of ideas in the local setting is quite different from their role in media-infused battles at the national level. Local arenas are frequently nonpartisan, with actors focused on immediate concerns, daily demands, and scarce resources. Because concrete actions may be more important than ideological posture, mass persuasion may be of less concern than enlistment of scattered cadres of task-specific activists. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706060348","529-546","Clarence Stone","George Washington, and University of Maryland <a href=mailto:cstone@gvpt.umd.edu>cstone@gvpt.umd.edu","and Donn Worgs","Towson University <a href=mailto:dworgs@ %0Atowson.edu>dworgs@ towson.edu","Marion Orr","Brown University <a href=mailto:Marion_Orr@brown.edu>Marion_Orr@brown.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2544","366"

This article puts forth hypotheses about how this marketization might affect three major literatures in international relations theory: the democratic peace, late state building, and theories of the frequency and nature of conflict. Relying on institutional logic, I argue that the marketization of security should redistribute power over the control of force. This redistribution should cause democracies to function differently&#8212;increasing the dilemmas between short-term security and long-term relations with other democracies. It should also reinforce the dilemmas pointed to by the literature on the resource curse and rentier states, thus deepening the expected difficulty of state building. Finally, as more states and non-state actors take advantage of market options for security, the oft-assumed collective monopoly of states over violence should suffer a blow. This should lead the chances for conflict to grow but also the purposes for which people and groups use violence to change. These propositions are not tested but serve as a call for further research. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706060336","507-528","Deborah Avant","George Washington University <a href=mailto:avant@gwu.edu>avant@gwu.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4752","1646"

The fear is that Muslims as a bloc will co-opt the domestic and foreign policy of various European states, subsuming it to those of Muslims from a variety of Islamic states in the Middle East and Asia, and transform the secular nature of most European states. The historic and ingrained fear of Islam present in the populations of Europe (and, for that matter, the United States) has produced an inability to see the political nature of Islamic groups, especially outside the Islamic world. For example, both Europeans and Americans were quick to question the political motives and actions of Muslims in Europe and the U.S. when there was no organized and orchestrated condemnation of the attacks of September 11, 2001. What such critics fail to take into account is precisely one of the themes analyzed in the paper: the myriad divisions found among the Muslims of Europe. Western fears and criticisms are partly based on serious ignorance of the characteristics of Islam and of the people in Europe who adhere to it. Because Islam is a highly decentralized religion, it is structurally biased against facilitating large-scale collective action by its adherents. The one version which is hierarchically organized, the Shi&#39;a, is barely present in Europe. In addition, Muslim immigrants are divided by their ethnic differences. Islam, being decentralized, allows for a myriad of practices in the different countries from which the immigrants came. Divided by ethnicity and by their own religious beliefs, Muslims in Europe will not constitute a group which will be able to impose its goals on European foreign and domestic policy. Muslims will, instead, be a diverse population with which European states find it difficult to negotiate, because of Islam&#39;s decentralized structure. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706060300","457-479","Carolyn M.

First, I justify the real-world importance of the topic, and thereby encourage other scholars to grapple with its manifestations and implications. Second, I present some suggestive evidence, based on the 15 &#8220;older&#8221; countries of the European Union (EU). The findings not only illustrate the extent of cross-national variation in citizenship policies at two different time periods, but they help to demonstrate the applicability of comparative analysis to categorizing and explaining both long-lasting cross-national differences and more recent change in some countries. In explaining the historical variation within the EU, I consider whether or not a country had a prior experience as a colonial power, as well as whether it became a democracy in the nineteenth century. In accounting for continuity or change over the last few decades, I argue that while various international and domestic pressures have led to liberalization in a number of countries, these usually occurred in the absence of public discussion and involvement. In contrast, when public opinion gets mobilized and engaged on issues related to citizenship reform&#8212;usually by a well-organized far right party, but also sometimes by a referendum or petition campaign&#8212;liberalization is usually blocked, or further restrictions are introduced.

By Richard Youngs. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. 232p. $99.00.In his seminal article published nearly 30 years ago, cleverly called &#8220;Second Image Reversed,&#8221; Peter Gourevitch outlined a set of arguments for why and how to study the international causes of domestic outcomes. This framework had a profound effect on several literatures, but only a minor ripple in the study of regime change. A handful of international relations scholars, including John Owen and Mark Peceny, have made important contributions to this field, and a smattering of comparativists have added the international dimension to their list of independent variables that influence regime type, but the subject could not be considered a mainstream field. In fact, the third-wave transitologists gave only passing attention to the international dimensions of democratization. Laurence Whitehead did write an important chapter on international dimensions of democratization in the four-volume study on transitions from autocratic rule edited by Louillermo O'Donnell, Philippe C. Schmitter, and Lawrence Whitehead. Yet, in one of the introductory essays in this study, Schmitter wrote that one &#8220;of the firmest conclusions that emerged &#8230; was that transitions from authoritarian rule and immediate prospects for political democracy were largely to be explained in terms of national forces and calculations. External actors tended to play an indirect and usually marginal role&#8221; (in O'Donnell, Schmitter, and Whitehead, eds., TransitionsfromAuthoritarianRule:SouthernEurope, 1986, p. 5). Scholars and policy analysts writing about democratization after the end of the Cold War have devoted more attention to international factors, yet the subject is still grossly neglected. This absence of scholarship is all the more surprising given the foreign policy debates in Washington, Brussels, Moscow, and Tehran about the role the United States in fostering &#8220;regime change.&#8221;<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706810479","819-820","Michael McFaul","Stanford University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","553","147"

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2005. 280p. $60.00 cloth, $24.00 paper.With the near quadrupling of the world population in the last century, the melting of the polar ice cap, and the increased frequency of hurricanes such as Katrina and other &#8220;natural&#8221; disasters, the issue of ecological security is receiving renewed attention. Ecological security focuses not only on threats resulting directly from environmental degradation but also on the economic ramifications of failed environmental policies, military threats that stem from conflicts over scarce resources, and ecologically related health risks. The idea of ecological security achieved a measure of popularity during the 1980s as researchers and policymakers began to consider the broad security implications of crises related to natural resources. In this new volume, the editors and contributing authors try to forecast the potential security ramifications of current environmental trends over the next 30 years. Ecological security serves as an umbrella term throughout the volume for evaluating the risks to humanity created by inaction, weak policies, or slow implementation of environmental policies regarding population, water, food, energy, global climate change, deforestation, and biodiversity.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706790478","816-817","Yael Wolinsky-Nahmias","Northwestern University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","547","125"

Although most of these studies focus on individual cases, scholars are increasingly developing theoretical frameworks and applying a comparative method to explain not individual genocides but the very phenomenon. Manus Midlarsky's highly ambitious, original, and impressive book aspires to bring us closer to understanding genocide in the contemporary age. Avoiding monocausal explanations that locate homicidal tendencies either in cultural or strategic variables, Midlarsky draws from international relations theory, comparative politics, and psychology to explain what makes genocide imaginable and executable. Written with controlled passion by a scholar deeply committed to using social science theory and methods to understand this highly emotional topic, TheKillingTrap is an invaluable contribution to genocide studies.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706780471","814-816","Michael Barnett","University of Minnesota","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","615","212"

Terrence Lyons captures the complex and often contradictory dynamics of elections in the wake of civil war peace agreements in his well-designed, thoroughly researched, and coherently argued book.

These three economic blocs are known in business schools as the &#8220;triad&#8221; of Europe, North America, and Asia.

The first examines the origins of institutions, seeking the causes of decentralization and federalism. The second explores the consequences of decentralization and federalism for such outcomes as fiscal performance, economic growth, and the welfare state.

The Russian government initially tried to persuade the other former Soviet republics to preserve a unified military force, but in May 1992, after those efforts had proven fruitless, Russian President Boris Yeltsin established a separate Russian army on the basis of what had been left over from the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet military had been deteriorating since the late 1980s, sweeping reform of the new Russian army seemed an urgent priority. Economic, military, social, demographic, and political considerations all pointed to the need for a much smaller army equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry and configured for plausible combat scenarios. Advocates of reform hoped to place the Russian military under strict civilian control, including parliamentary oversight, and to replace the mass, conscript-based system of the Soviet army with a fully professional force. They also hoped to devise a completely new military doctrine that would be appropriate for the realities of the post-Soviet era.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706620471","794-795","Mark Kramer","Harvard University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","668","119"

The study contends that these new Arab media outlets have freed the dissemination of information from the shackles of state control, challenged old taboos on open discussion, and generated free debate about pertinent political and social issues&#8212;culture and identity, political reform, Palestine, Islam and modernity, and Iraq, among others.

By Consuelo Cruz. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 302p. $80.00.Political culture has remained an attractive subject since works such as Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba's TheCivicCulture:PoliticalAttitudesandDemocracyinFiveNations (1963) propelled it to the fore of comparative politics in the 1960s. Over the last four decades, different approaches to political culture sought to provide theoretical leverage on an array of political phenomena, including political participation, modernization, democratic development, and state building. The appeal of the concept of political culture lies primarily in its intuitive logic: Individuals, organized into groups, are responsible for the creation of political realities. While these realities may certainly be influenced by an array of exogenous factors, their creation is dependent on individuals' perceptions and preferences. Critics of political culture research suggest that attributions of political culture are frequently deterministic or difficult to falsify scientifically. In PoliticalCultureandInstitutionalDevelopmentinCostaRicaandNicaragua, Consuelo Cruz analyzes political culture employing what she refers to as an integrative approach, a rational-structural culturalism that recognizes the direct influence of morally driven, rational political actors on institutional norms.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706580478","789-790","Christina Schatzman","Arizona State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","631","105"

Conaghan traces the major events of the presidency of Alberto Fujimori, starting in 1990 with his rise to power out of political obscurity and continuing through his departure from office in disgrace in 2000 after winning a highly controversial third term. The author characterizes the Fujimori regime as a &#8220;permanent coup,&#8221; whereby government officials repeatedly eviscerated the country's constitution and subverted the rule of law. A central theme of the book is the Fujimori government's inability through various unsuccessful attempts to completely dominate the political discourse despite persistent and sophisticated efforts to control the public sphere. As Conaghan writes, &#8220;The history of the Fujimori presidency is a chronicle of wrongdoing and complicity, but it is also a story about resistance and the limits of public deception in modern politics&#8221; (p. 13).

Edited by Zoltan Barany and Robert G. Moser. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2005. 296p. $19.95.In the wake of communism's collapse, dire predictions of intractable ethno-religious conflict throughout the post-Soviet and East Central European territories were the order of the day. Although ethnic violence overshadowed opportunities for political transformation in the Caucuses and Balkans during the 1990s, many of the potential fault lines of ethnic conflict have weathered the tumultuous period of transition either without incident or via institutionally regulated means. While it is fortunate in human terms that the latent ethnic tensions in most instances fell short of their genocidal potential, the failure of political science and sociology to predict accurately the scope of ethnic conflict resulting from the implosion of communist regimes highlights the limitations of social science, especially when the events it purports to explain are rapidly unfolding. With a firm grasp of these limitations and 15 years of hindsight, Zoltan Barany and Robert Moser, in their edited volume, reassess the impact that regime change and state collapse have had on identity and ethnicity and, in turn, how ethnicity and nationalism have shaped the transitions from real socialism.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706550479","786-787","D.

Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006. 298p. $29.95.Robert Wuthnow's insightful book examines the stories that we Americans like to believe about ourselves, not so much for the purpose of discovering whether those stories are true&#8212;though he presents plenty of evidence to show both truth and falsity in them&#8212;as for the sake of showing what the United States needs to become a better nation. The falsity in those &#8220;narratives&#8221; makes our perceptions of ourselves biased (p. 1), he argues; but because they function at the level of &#8220;deep meaning&#8221; behind our collective thinking (p. 25), we rarely question their validity. Such questioning should be the work of &#8220;reflective democracy&#8221; (p. 3), a combination of opinions from experts and the masses. Since the United States is a country of immigrants, Wuthnow relies on interviews with &#8220;new immigrant elites because they provide a particularly interesting informational context in which to examine ideas about cultural renewal&#8221; (p. 9). It stands to reason that elites will be more interesting than the masses, but is Wuthnow's sample a good way to gauge the prospects for democracy? &#8220;Cultural renewal&#8221; involves families, schools, and civic associations, but it is not always clear what he means by culture. At times he gives the word an entirely intellectual meaning (e.g., &#8220;basic values and &#8230; taken-for-granted understandings of what it means to be good people and to live responsibly in a good society&#8221; [p. 14]).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706540472","784-786","David Fott","University of Nevada, Las Vegas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","423","30"

Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005. 284p. $39.50.Peter Nardulli's book blends syntheses of previous research and new empirical analysis to address the question of the capacity of American voters to hold political leaders accountable through elections&#8212;to achieve, that is, &#8220;popular efficacy.&#8221; The book begins by interpreting previous scholarly research as depicting voters as &#8220;manageable fools&#8221; because of their limited cognitive abilities for political evaluation (Chapter 2) and their habitual reliance on party identifications to dictate their vote choices (Chapter 4). Given this, why do politicians pay attention to public concerns? The original empirical analysis of the book answers this question. It shows how variations in and deviations from the normal vote are related to exogenous forces beyond the control of politicians, rather than habitual party loyalties or political strategies. The realization that their fortunes are tied to forces beyond their control, in turn, induces strategic politicians to be responsive to the public's core concerns.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706510473","781-782","Paul Allen Beck","Ohio State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","438","42"

By John G. Geer. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006. 218p. $47.50 cloth, $19.00 paper.This book begins with a series of quotes from scholars and media pundits arguing that negative political advertisements are uncivil, mean-spirited, emotion-laden distortions of the truth, which not only smear their target but also mislead voters and undermine the political process itself; in short, they are the scourge of democracy. Or so the conventional wisdom goes. But John Geer asks us to reject the starting assumption that attack ads are bad. In fact, he argues that democracy requires candidates to attack each other. His argument is simple but powerful: All advertisements, by their very nature, exaggerate the truth. But this point applies equally to negative and positive ads. We cannot expect political candidates to fairly discuss their weaknesses along with their strengths. That is the role of the opposition, and it can only be done by offering criticisms of the opposing candidate or party. The real questions, then, are 1) whether negative ads perform their role effectively, or instead distort and confuse the vote choices citizens must make; and 2) whether attack ads, in performing a role that seems to be required of them, nonetheless undermine the democratic political system of which they are a crucial part.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706440470","772-773","Richard R.

This failure to fully explore one of the critical links between citizens and their representatives has left us with an incomplete understanding of how, or even whether, the local news media facilitate representation and accountability. R. Douglas Arnold's new book takes a significant step toward addressing this gap with an ambitious and rich study of the local news media's role in providing (or not providing) the information necessary for citizens to hold their elected officials accountable. While Arnold notes that citizens may receive information about their House members from various sources, he argues that local newspapers are unique among these information providers because, ideally, they act as independent monitors as well as forums for the airing of diverse opinions.

The conviction that it has, according to the French political philosopher Pierre Manent, is what animates sophisticated European thought today. The self-understandings of the creature, the parent, and, above all, the citizen have increasingly been displaced by that of the individual. And what an individual is is determined by the individual, and whatever he or she decides for him- or herself is dignified and deserves our respect. The idea of dignity is being liberated from any particular human content, from any particular conception of human goodness or morality. That means, among other things, that the idea of human rights has been liberated from any conception of civic or national obligation. So the idea of compulsory national military service is an affront to the individual's dignity, and in the name of human dignity the Europeans increasingly seem even to believe that they can unilaterally become pro-choice on war.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706330472","758-759","Peter Augustine Lawler","Berry College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1829","108"

For those unfamiliar with this well-developed tendency of feminist thought, she reviews its evolution from the 1980s writings of Sara Ruddick, Carol Gilligan, and Nel Noddings to the more recent work of theorists including, among many others, Eva Kittay, Annette Baier, Joan Tronto, and Selma Sevenhuijsen. Held also underlines the differences between the ethics of care and dominant moral and political perspectives, including Kantian universalism, utilitarianism, liberal contract theory, and virtue theory. She proposes that care is, compared with justice, the more basic value, on the grounds that society can exist without the latter but not without the former. She recommends that men and women participate equally in care activities; that care infuse citizen as well as familial relations; and that society beat back the imperializing thrust of the market ethos and the conflict-mongering thrust of the militarized state to improve the well-being of children, the elderly, the sick and disabled, the community, culture, the environment, and deprived regions of the world.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270631047X","755-757","Joan Cocks","Mount Holyoke College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1139","229"

By Mary Caputi. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005. 232p. $58.50 cloth, $19.50 paper.Given the controversies that have plagued the present administration, it is little wonder that critiques of neoconservatives have been produced by scholars from all perspectives. Even Francis Fukuyama, widely reputed to be one of the great neoconservative thinkers, has released a trenchant critique of neoconservatives' ideas and policies (AmericaattheCrossroads, 2006). In her contribution to this growing chorus, Mary Caputi argues that neoconservatives have used and abused history in creating a mythical image of America's past, an idealized narrative about American life in &#8220;the fifties&#8221; that she contrasts with the complex historical strata of the chronological 1950s. She argues that the neoconservatives have cultivated, popularized, and exploited a misleading and incomplete image of a &#8220;kinder, gentler America&#8221; to generate a peculiarly powerful melancholia that haunts us with the memory of what we (supposedly) were and what we might (erroneously wish to) be again. Only by seeing through this idealized vision of that decade can we &#8220;understand that America's true identity is not located in some mythological register of time&#8221; and thus &#8220;let go of the worries and sadness that drive the need for foundations&#8221; and moral certainties (p. 27).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270626047X","749-750","Joseph H.

And if they do not change, then it is efficient that they not change&#8221; (p. 214). When, contrary to theoretical expectations, institutions change or fail to change in a way that economists take to be inefficient, then this is said to be the result of collective (political) interference with and distortion of otherwise efficient individual choices. Such interference is explained by appealing to the irrationality or ignorance of political actors (Daniel Bromley calls this the &#8220;dimwit conjecture,&#8221; p. 124) or, perhaps more commonly, by the fact that the political process has been captured by &#8220;special interests.&#8221;<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706250473","747-749","Eric MacGilvray","Ohio State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","522","44"

By Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. 339p. $59.50 cloth, $29.95 paper.Much of social science has been devoted to the analysis of different mechanisms for social steering. The most well-known are the &#8220;invisible hand&#8221; market and the &#8220;iron hand&#8221; state. In many studies, these systems of coordination have been put forward as the only two that are available, and we have seen endless amounts of energy going into the pros and cons for each in different areas. In this book, two renowned scholars, one an economist (Geoffrey Brennan) and the other a political philosopher (Philip Pettit), put forward a third mechanism that they argue has largely been neglected, namely, esteem. The central idea is that while people are motivated by material benefits and by the incentives given by laws and regulations, they are also motivated by the opinions other people hold of them. In addition to material rewards, we also want other people we care about to think well of us. The authors argue that this esteem mechanism has largely been overlooked in modern neoclassical economics but that it was a major part of earlier economics, not least in Adam Smith's &#8220;A Theory of Moral Sentiments,&#8221; which was published in 1759, 13 years before &#8220;The Wealth of Nations.&#8221;<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706240477","746-747","Bo Rothstein","G&ouml;teborg University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","535","69"

By Eileen Hunt Botting. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2006. 258p. $65.00.This book reminds us of the importance of theorizing the family/state relationship. Eileen Hunt Botting argues that while Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Edmund Burke proposed different versions of a patriarchal structuring of the family in contrast to Mary Wollstonecraft's egalitarian version, the three eighteenth-century theorists shared a view of the function of the family as providing the relational and moral foundations for the state. To relate as a father, husband, son, wife, sister, or daughter was to learn how to sympathize, and to work for a common purpose, both of which were absolutely necessary for developing patriotic feelings and civic virtue. The significance of the book goes beyond taking us back to the Enlightenment origins of the notion of the family as an agent of political socialization. It raises crucial questions about Wollstonecraft's status as a canonical democratic theorist; it also suggests fascinating implications for how political theory could make a contribution to our contemporary conversations on gay families, religion and the family, and the clash of civilizations and the family.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706230470","745-746","Wendy Sarvasy","California State University, East Bay","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","779","130"

Allen argues that Tocqueville's new political science is essentially a prescription for a democratic society in which political culture reflects the beliefs, values, and behaviors of covenantal religion.

By Donald Alexander Downs. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 318p. $28.99 cloth, $19.99 paper.Donald Downs's RestoringFreeSpeechandLibertyonCampus is an important book. Like his earlier books, it integrates political theory, jurisprudence, and policy analysis to address a matter of contemporary concern. In this case, the matter at hand is directly relevant to all scholars and teachers who work in the contemporary American university. Since this includes most political scientists, it seemed like a good idea to open the pages of the Perspectives Book Reviews to a range of perspectives on the book. I have thus sought out a &#8220;balanced&#8221; cast of distinguished commentators, in the hope that the juxtaposition of different reviews will help to promote serious discussion of academic freedom issues of concern to all of us. Some of these issues are juridical, and regard the ways in which universities, academic departments, and perhaps even professional associations are called upon to codify &#8220;diversity&#8221; considerations and balance these with other considerations, including &#8220;academic excellence&#8221; but also civil liberty and robust debate. Some of them are principally ethical, and regard the habits of mind most conducive to intellectual inquiry and liberal education. These issues are complicated and controversial. In featuring the Downs volume and the three reviews that follow, I sought to stimulate intelligent discussion about them within the political science profession.

Despite&#8212;or perhaps because of&#8212;the sprawl of different treatments of identity in the social sciences, the concept has remained too analytically loose to be as useful a tool as the literature&#39;s early promise had suggested. We propose to solve this longstanding problem by developing the analytical rigor and methodological imagination that will make identity a more useful variable for the social sciences. This article offers more precision by defining collective identity as a social category that varies along two dimensions&#8212;content and contestation. Content describes the meaning of a collective identity. The content of social identities may take the form of four non-mutually-exclusive types: constitutive norms; social purposes; relational comparisons with other social categories; and cognitive models. Contestation refers to the degree of agreement within a group over the content of the shared category. Our conceptualization thus enables collective identities to be compared according to the agreement and disagreement about their meanings by the members of the group. The final section of the article looks at the methodology of identity scholarship. Addressing the wide array of methodological options on identity&#8212;including discourse analysis, surveys, and content analysis, as well as promising newer methods like experiments, agent-based modeling, and cognitive mapping&#8212;we hope to provide the kind of brush clearing that will enable the field to move forward methodologically as well. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <a href='#fnb'><sup>b</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592706060440","695-711","and Rose McDermott","Political Science Department, University of California at Santa Barbara (E-mail: <a href=mailto:rmcdermott@polsci.ucsb.edu>rmcdermott@polsci.ucsb.edu)","Rawi Abdelal","Harvard Business School (E-mail: <a href=mailto:rabdelal@hbs.edu>rabdelal@hbs.edu)","Alastair Iain Johnston","Government Department, Harvard University (E-mail: <a href=mailto:johnston@fas.harvard.edu>johnston@fas.harvard.edu)","Yoshiko M.

This vitality is, in turn, fortifying the role of religion in European politics in two closely related ways. In the first place, the close ties between religious tradition and national identity that new member-states and candidate-states are introducing to the EU hold the very real potential of reviving political recognition of the Christian, and specifically Catholic, roots of European integration. Western Europe may be said to have preserved Christianity only as glimmering embers that are not able to generate much heat, on their own. But when fanned, in very different ways, by Catholic Poland, Orthodox Serbia, or Islamic Turkey, those embers are much more likely to flicker back into flames. Second, the greater attention to religious difference that this renewed vitality implies could itself ignite political reactions and conflicts that are likely to impede the process of &#8220;Europeanization.&#8221; Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Islam are transnational religious traditions that each have their own understanding of European identity, European unity, and even of European modernity. These religious understandings and definitions, animated politically in complex ways in places like Warsaw, Belgrade, and Ankara, may not be consistent with how these concepts are defined and understood in, say, Paris, Berlin, or Brussels. As these religious traditions, and the national communities partly defined by them, are drawn more deeply into the project of European integration through enlargement, religion will also get drawn more deeply into European public life. Put another way, religion, widely presumed to have been consigned to the political margins in Europe, is now poised to play an important role in one of the most central political processes of contemporary European life. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Timothy A.

HIV/AIDS Organizations and Identity","AIDS first manifested itself in the early 1980s as an apparent &#8220;gay disease.&#8221; Cases soon appeared outside the industrialized west and among other communities. Given HIV's modes of transmission, sex workers, drug injectors, and those who engaged in unprotected nonmonogamous sex were at higher risk, and the political economy of the virus was such that communities on domestic as well as international margins had the highest prevalence. Governments were slow to respond seriously. In their place, segments of the gay and lesbian community united by the late 1980s to educate, protect, and care for themselves, even in countries in which cases of homosexual transmission comprise a relatively small proportion of infections. At times, governments' abdication of responsibility left those nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) less closely-scrutinized than others&#8212;most notable where associational life is generally subject to illiberal controls&#8212;leaving them relatively free to advance explicit or implicit community-building among their marginalized constituencies. Though governments and media gained interest as heterosexual transmission rates rose, both still neglected the highest-risk groups. Importantly, the perspectives, perceived constituencies, and approaches of HIV/AIDS-related NGOs may diverge sharply from those of public health authorities, with unambiguous consequences in terms of the relative empowerment, receptivity to messages, and, ultimately, behaviors of target communities. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Meredith L.

When the AIDS epidemic was recognized in 1981, the gay movement had already reconstituted itself as a legitimate interest group pursuing civil rights and civil liberties. Building on the preexisting organizational foundations as well as cultural capital of the gay movement as well as others, the AIDS movement was not only able to push for the protection of the civil rights of people living with AIDS, but through its engagement with the medical profession and the political establishment over access to drugs, was able to insist on a correlation between health and human rights. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Krista Johnson is Assistant Professor at Agnes Scott College in Atlanta (krmjohnson@agnesscott.edu).

In the long run, generally between 1986 and 1990, the industrialized democracies where a new illness was first identified did implement comprehensive disease prevention, blood safety, and treatment and care regimes specifically targeting AIDS; in the short run, these same countries struggled over&#8212;and more often then not failed to implement&#8212;appropriate measures to stem the spread of the epidemic.

By Daniel Verdier. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003. 326p. $65.00 cloth, $23.99 paper.Although it may seem arcane or prosaic to some, the literature on the political economy of money and finance has burgeoned within political science since the mid-1980s. The two decades after the end of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s was a time of considerable macroeconomic volatility and cooperative effort to coordinate suitable policy responses. This stimulated scholarly inquiry. Since then, financial globalization has drawn in those interested in the challenge financial markets seem to pose to the official political order centered on states. This developing political science research tradition has, however, existed on the periphery of two other longer-standing literatures. The first is the economic history of monetary and financial affairs. This tradition has exhaustively investigated the formation, organization, and implications of the classical gold standard and the Bretton Woods order. This research stimulated many of the political science pioneers and remains seminal and vibrant. The other tradition to mention is that impulse in the social sciences to identify and characterize different forms, tendencies, or cycles in capitalism, and link these to distinct political and social orders. This much more controversial way of thinking has its origins in the great nineteenth-century systems of ideas. In more recent times, Karl Polanyi, Joseph A. Schumpeter, Alexander Gerschenkron, John Zysman, and the many authors associated with core-periphery and world systems theory have kept the tradition alive. Although many readers will assume Daniel Verdier's new book is unproblematically part of the political science tradition, it should be read squarely as a product of this last tendency, making use of the established historical work to generate a reinterpretation.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705710148","209-210","Timothy J.

In our meetings, the distinctions between the Self and the Other (to use the constructivist jargon favored by Andrei P. Tsygankov in the book under review) have often been rather arbitrary.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. 336p. $99.00.Dale Murphy addresses the study of globalization, specifically global regulatory competition, with the careful empirical work of a former banker and the analytical bite of a political science scholar. The result is a coherent theoretical statement about when, and under what conditions, states will dismantle regulations (the colloquial &#8220;race to the bottom,&#8221; or &#8220;competition-in-laxity&#8221; as Murphy labels it), harmonize them to the highest level (a trend David Vogel named the &#8220;California effect&#8221;), or allow heterogeneous regulations to prevail. What sets Murphy's book apart from other political science scholarship in this area is that he abandons the assumption that corporations have monolithic regulatory preferences, and instead unpacks the &#8220;black box&#8221; of the corporation. He then gives corporate preferences weight in the regulatory process. Thus, the motivations and preferences of corporations are significant drivers of a state's regulations, and determine whether regulations will be harmonized upward or downward in international regulatory competition: &#8220;Powerful firms exert influence but they do not seek a monotonic goal; one must identify each firm's different interests. Over time, these preferences will shape state regulations&#8221; (p. 9).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705670144","205-206","Dorothee Heisenberg","Johns Hopkins University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","797","128"

By Gil Merom. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003. 310p. $65.00 cloth, $22.99 paper.The essence of Gil Merom's argument in this book is that democratic strong actors cannot win small wars because these states are constrained by society to avoid the sacrifice&#8212;in both sustained and inflicted casualties&#8212;necessary to win: &#8220;My argument is that democracies fail in small wars because they find it extremely difficult to escalate the level of violence and brutality to that which can secure victory. They are restricted by their domestic structure, and in particular by the creed of some of their most articulate citizens and the opportunities their institutional makeup presents such citizens. Other states are not prone to lose small wars, and when they do fail in such wars it is mostly for realist reasons&#8221; (p. 15). Merom adds that &#8220;[e]ssentially, what prevents modern democracies from winning small wars is disagreement between state and society over expedient and moral issues that concern human life and dignity&#8230;.

By Jonathan Fox. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2004. 312p. $75.00.Jonathan Fox's book makes a very important contribution to the ongoing debate on the impact of religion on domestic conflict. On the one hand, the author takes issue with Samuel Huntington's clash-of-civilizations thesis. As many others before him, Fox does not find much quantitative support for Huntington's bold expectations: We neither experience a major reorganization of international relations along civilizationally defined fault lines nor observe a significant increase in the number of violent disputes involving parties from different civilizations. On the other hand, he objects to those recent studies according to which the onset of civil wars is determined by political and economic factors, while religion is found to be largely irrelevant (see, for instance, James Fearon and David Laitin, &#8220;Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War,&#8221; AmericanPoliticalScienceReview 97 [no. 1, 2003]: 75&#8211;90, or Errol Henderson and David J.

By using data both from the Minorities at Risk Project (MAR) and the State Failure Project (SF), Religion,Civilization,andCivilWar provides strong evidence that religious identity&#8212;whether the conflict involves two groups who belong to different religions or to different denominations&#8212;and, even more so, religious grievances do influence conflict escalation.

Unfortunately, neorealists are unable to recognize the increasing importance of regional interactions because they focus exclusively on the global level. Equally regrettable is the fact that newer globalization perspectives are unable to capture regional security relations adequately because they, too, severely downgrade the importance of states and/or assume that reactions to forces like globalization do not meaningfully differ across regions.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 318p. $70.00 cloth, $25.99 paper.The English School of international relations has been principally concerned with understanding the society of states, but some of its members have commented on its relationship with world society. Hedley Bull and Martin Wight noted that the architects of the modern society of states derived some of their political vocabulary from medieval conceptions of world society. Bull maintained that natural law images of a world society survived in the modern doctrine of universal human rights. Whether a world society was likely to develop in the first universal society of states was a question of great importance to Bull and John Vincent. The former referred to an emerging &#8220;cosmopolitan culture of modernity&#8221; that could underpin order between radically different societies in &#8220;the post-European age&#8221;; the latter believed a global culture that established the right of every human being to be free from starvation could perform that function. However, most members of the English School have denied that the modern society of states is likely to be dissolved in a world society. Indeed, Wight argued that from the Reformation, rival conceptions of world society have often had a divisive effect on international relations. Barry Buzan's most recent book is the first work by a member of the school to consider world society since Vincent's call for the more systematic investigation of the concept almost 15 years ago.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270560014X","196-197","Andrew Linklater","University of Wales, Aberystwyth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1161","553"

Edited by Kurt Weyland. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004. 320p. $60.00 cloth, $22.95 paper.The purpose of this important volume, whose contributors include both policy practitioners and academics, is to &#8220;elucidate the cognitive and political processes that shape the diffusion of models in contemporary Latin America&#8221; (p. 2). In his introductory chapter, Kurt Weyland lays out a series of questions to help frame an assessment of the impact of foreign models on Latin American social policy reforms during the last two decades. When do policymakers turn to external models? What turns a country's policy practices into a model for others? How is information about a particular model spread abroad? What is the impact of transmitted models on policy decision makers and how, if at all, are they adapted to local conditions? Weyland argues that the concept of &#8220;learning&#8221; is better suited to addressing these questions than either the traditional rational choice or structuralist approaches alone, since learning creates &#8220;important filters between objective reality and actors' attitudes and actions&#8221; (p. 6). Various heuristic shortcuts are taken by policymakers that significantly alter the expected cost&#8211;benefit calculation that, it is often assumed, decides the diffusion of foreign models. This framework is applied fairly consistently in a series of case study chapters that focus on three social sector reforms carried out in the region: pension systems (Argentina, Brazil), unemployment insurance (Brazil, Chile) and health care (Colombia, Mexico).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705590145","195-196","Philip Mauceri","University of Northern Iowa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","557","145"

The purpose is to determine whether the shape of political institutions has measurable impact on economic policies (e.g., fiscal balance, social welfare spending), on government performance (e.g., corruption indices, protection of property rights), and on direct measures of economic performance (e.g., productivity of capital and labor).

Scores of scholars followed Maurice Duverger's lead, emphasizing how institutions affect the strategic environment facing political actors and the contours of party systems. Other researchers followed Seymour Martin Lipset's and Stein Rokkan's lead, privileging social cleavages as the main features influencing party system development. Recently, scholars have attempted to reconcile or integrate the competing approaches.

Its now legalistic form more nearly resembles the long-prevalent American pattern. Perhaps the British development would seem to follow from the privatization of industries in the last two decades of the twentieth century. Enterprises like railroads, telecommunications, and electricity are no longer government corporations but privately owned &#8220;public utilities,&#8221; to use the American term for businesses especially affected by the public interest. For Moran, however, other forces also help account for the growth of regulation in Britain.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 264p. $70.00.Marcus Kurtz makes his contribution to a sizable body of works examining the impact of economic liberalization on political opening in Latin America, arguing that the countryside in Latin America offers us a crucial piece of the puzzle of why transitions to democracies may succeed despite widening social inequalities. The answer to this paradox, Kurtz argues, is that &#8220;competitive national-level democracy [is] based in part on conservative hegemony and peasant quiescence in the countryside&#8221; (p. 21). He contends that processes put in place by market-based policies, rather than coercion or clientelism, explain why peasants and rural workers continued to back the politicians who initiated and deepened programs of credit deregulation, price liberalization, and trade opening. Thus, the grim lesson of FreeMarketDemocracyandtheChileanandMexicanCountryside: If those with the most to lose in neoliberal conditions are quickly atomized and dispossessed by transitions to market-based conditions, competitive multiparty electoral systems will endure at national levels. Or, in a semantic twist worthy of Alice in the rabbit hole, in modern conditions, democracy thrives on a certain lack of it.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705530147","188-190","Heather Williams","Pomona College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","531","75"

Two new studies seek to give finer-grain comparative analysis of party development in the relatively successful new democracies of Southern and East Central Europe. Tom&aacute;&#353; Kosteleck&yacute;'s PoliticalPartiesAfterCommunism aims to give a broad overview of the development of party politics in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Kosteleck&yacute; first outlines the historical evolution of parties in the four cases from the midnineteenth century until the collapse of communism and then gives a detailed survey of the development of parties and electoral politics between 1989 and 2002. Subsequent chapters take a more thematic approach, reviewing and synthesizing a range of research to assess the impact of political culture, historical legacies, social cleavages, and the institutional &#8220;rules of the game&#8221; on party development.

Development administration has been a subfield very much in limbo for the past two decades as the market and civil society have attracted prime interest among development analysts and practitioners. Anil Hira and Trevor Parfitt argue that development assistance agencies, such as the United States Agency for International Development, its bilateral counterparts in Europe, and the World Bank, continue to insist on a mode of operation that perpetuates the same weaknesses that were identified in earlier literature on development administration and management. These agencies insist on short time spans for the activities that they fund. They treat these projects as if void of people. They fail to share information with potential beneficiaries. Above all, they do not hold themselves to the same high standards of accountability and transparency that they impose on recipients of their aid. With more and more development activities being carried out by community-based organizations and other nongovernmental bodies, these aid agencies have increasingly become part of the problem, not just the solution.

Is Chinese nationalism benign or malign? The rise of Chinese nationalism in recent times has become an issue of great interest and importance to the world because of concerns over China's intentions as economic growth propels the country's ascendance onto the world stage. This timely account analyzes the sources and dimensions of the new nationalism, from what Peter Hays Gries calls the &#8220;rarely told Chinese side of the story&#8221; (p. 4). It is premised on a refreshing perspective that &#8220;to understand Chinese nationalism, we must listen to the Chinese&#8221; (p. 4). Gries's attempt to introduce Western scholars to the views of these new nationalists is an important contribution in itself, as so often mainstream views of Chinese nationalism in the West construe it as a tool to legitimize Communist Party rule.

As a result, disentangling the effects of protest on policy presents an ongoing analytical challenge. If we look, for example, at the volatile and diverse movement against the American war in Vietnam, it is virtually impossible to track clear lines of influence between the volume or disruptiveness of protests covered in the news and spending on the war or casualties produced in battle. At the same time, by reviewing memoirs, archives, and the broader outlines of policy, we know that the movement had longer-term effects, including (minimally), ending military conscription and establishing much stricter political and military tests for long-term commitments of American combat forces overseas. The latter set of constraints, codified as the Weinberger, then the Powell, doctrines, held sway over American military policy from the end of Vietnam until, finally, violated by the current American intervention in Iraq. At the same time, politicians of both parties vigorously try to reassure nervous youth, many of whom are children of the protest generation, that the draft is indeed gone for good. Clearly, the protests against the Vietnam war mattered, though perhaps not exactly in the ways that activists hoped or as much as they dreamed.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705460144","179-180","David S.

The title of this book is slightly misleading, though, because even while it concedes that appeals for political support on the basis of ethnic categories based on &#8220;race, caste, tribe or religion&#8221; (p. 2) are frequently made, sometimes with considerable success, it asserts that such tactics do not always succeed. When they do, it is not necessarily because of their putative appeal to sentiments but, instead, because both ethnic candidates and their supporters, rather than being swayed by appeals to their nonrational selves, are actually driven by sophisticated calculations of expected gain. Their utility calculus takes the size of the ultimate prize as well as the probability of winning it into account when they choose to align themselves with one set of politicians as opposed to another.

By Linda Faye Williams. University Park: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2003. 440p. $35.00 cloth, $27.95 paper.Linda Faye Williams's book seeks to identify &#8220;how, when and why American social policy became fused with the politics of race&#8221; and what that has meant for the development and evolution of the welfare state in the United States. The author's central argument is that the welfare state was &#8220;grafted onto preexisting conditions of race relations,&#8221; and the long-term consequence of this grafting is that even today, the organization of social policy in the United States continues to reproduce advantages for whites and disadvantages for many people of color. Further, as social welfare policy institutionalizes white advantage, this in turn tends to block movement in the direction of more universalistic social policy (p. 14). Williams supports this contention by revisiting the political history of social welfare policy, from just after the Civil War up to the Clinton administration's efforts at welfare &#8220;reform&#8221; in 1996.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705380145","169-171","Dean E.

By Paul Teske. Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 2004. 272p. $52.95 cloth, $22.95 paper.Government regulation of economic activity is endemic to modern society; a vast array of everyday transactions are affected&#8212;and shaped&#8212;by rules and requirements imposed by governments. The intentions behind such regulations are typically assumed to be benign. Through regulation, governments can rectify problems caused by deceit, unaccounted costs, or unchecked power that would otherwise limit the scope and the effectiveness of markets. From a fiscal perspective, regulation is a relatively low-cost form of government activity. The budgets of regulatory agencies represent small items of government expenditure, compared with the budgets of agencies engaging in service provision or income redistribution. Because government regulation of economic activity is very often taken for granted and is of low salience to citizens, it is rarely the stuff of headline news. Among scholars, regulation has also tended to receive short shrift. Yet, as an area of public policy research, the study of government regulation deserves close scrutiny. At its best, research in this area can provide insights into the intersections of markets and governments, using the tools of positive political economy to good effect.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705360142","167-168","Michael Mintrom","University of Auckland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Edited by Will Kymlicka and Alan Patten. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003. 368p. $99.00 cloth, $24.95 paper.Language rights and language policy are significant issues in contemporary politics and have become an important subject for political theorists today. Yet until now, there has been no major work or edited volume dealing with language rights from the standpoint of normative political theory. Will Kymlicka and Alan Patten have put together a volume of essays to remedy this situation. According to the editors of this valuable collection, linguistic diversity has emerged as a major source of controversy in a number of distinct political contexts. In their comprehensive introduction to the topic, and the volume, they identify these contexts as including at least five areas: Eastern Europe, regional languages/minority nationalisms, immigrant integration, European Union/transnational democracy, and indigenous languages/biodiversity. As political theorists in recent years have explored ideas of citizenship, nationhood, multiculturalism, and deliberative democracy, it has become increasingly evident, they say, that political theories often rest on presuppositions about people's language repertoires. It is important that these presuppositions, and their implications, be explored and subjected to critical scrutiny. The aim of this collection is to do precisely this. In the end, it is entirely successful in its ambitions. The chapters are of high quality and deal with issues that are important.

The first is personal. It is a &#8220;critical homage&#8221; to the post&#8211;World War II scholars who were Ira Katznelson's teachers. Practicing their craft &#8220;in the midst of a moment stamped by the greatest shocks and stresses the Enlightenment tradition had ever faced,&#8221; these scholars produced a powerful revision of American Enlightenment liberalism that Katznelson believes could serve as a guidepost for today (p. 157). Confronting the &#8220;twentieth-century compound of total war, totalitarianism, and holocaust,&#8221; they would neither simply reaffirm the faith in reason and science as secular grounds of moral progress nor simply repudiate ideals of autonomy and freedom as &#8220;mere fantasy or, worse, the main source of radical evil&#8221; (pp. 33, 39). They &#8220;sought instead to renew and protect the Enlightenment's heritage by appropriating and transforming social science, history, and the study of public policy&#8221; so as to provide illumination in the face of desolation (p. xiii).

By Leonard C. Feldman. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 2004. 224p. $35.00.American attitudes toward the homeless tend to shift back and forth between compassion and compassion fatigue, between supporting policies to provide resources to the homeless and supporting punitive policies to exclude them from public spaces. This ambivalence is often explained by invoking &#8220;economic functionality&#8221; and/or &#8220;a cultural logic&#8221; (p. 5), but neither of these approaches is adequate. Rather, Leonard Feldman argues, we should see the problem of homelessness as a &#8220;problem of sovereign state power&#8221; (p. 18). Citizenship, and political life generally, are defined in opposition to &#8220;bare life,&#8221; or &#8220;mere physical existence&#8221;: Citizenship as full membership is constituted as the exclusion of bare life&#8221; (p. 18). Feldman continues, &#8220;Home-dwelling citizen and homeless bare life are political statuses, not social statuses or elements of personal identity&#8221; (p. 20), and so an adequate response to homelessness must also be political. He calls for a move toward a &#8220;pluralized citizenship&#8221; (p. 21), in which we deconstruct &#8220;the rigid oppositions between &#8230; bare life and citizenship.&#8221; Acknowledging a plurality of ways of dwelling, we can then recognize &#8220;that those displaced from &#8216;house&#8217; and &#8216;home&#8217; must dwell &#8230; and that public policy should be oriented toward enabling dwelling, not criminalizing it or reducing it to the stripped down client relationship of the shelter&#8221; (p. 147). More specifically, rather than repressing the habitats and networks that the homeless have themselves created, we should recognize these communities, including, in particular, &#8220;politicized homeless encampments&#8221; (p. 107) as participants in the political processes through which we formulate policy.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705250144","154-155","J.

This idea has informed both the theory of international law (e.g., a right to democratic governance) and the practice of American foreign policy (e.g., Bush Doctrine). A counterargument is built on the suspicion that institutional political/economic process is largely independent of the propensity of a state to cooperate in international relations, and that a focus on democracy and markets as a cure-all for international dispute settlement distracts both theorist and practitioner from the real problems that plague the international system.

And it will be a very contested work, first, because of what I think are a number of questionable assertions the author makes about the views of those he discusses, particularly Nietzsche and Weber; second, because of the completely unhistorical and uncontextual methodology the author employs to throw light on these thinkers so close to us in time, yet immersed in such different social and cultural milieus; and third, because of the larger thesis and framework of the interpretation, which convey great depth of concern and sincerity, but which, I think, are very problematical as an interpretation of these thinkers.

To address it, she constructs a conversation among psychoanalytic political theorists, psychoanalytic group theorists, and black feminist theorists. As the structure of the book makes clear, Burack hopes to broaden her audience to readers unfamiliar with any or all of these discourses. She intends to convince students of politics and feminists (particularly black feminists) that psychoanalytic theory can contribute much to understanding the dynamics of that ubiquitous feature of political life, groups. Furthermore, she wants to bridge the disciplinary gap between those who study groups and those who engage in discourse analysis. Discourse analysts are presently primarily located in humanities and cultural studies, and when they employ psychoanalytic thinking, it tends to be the Lacanian strand.

At a general level, this accepted wisdom is hard to dispute. Yet, like all such propositions, its heuristic usefulness cuts two ways: Embracing it wholesale makes for an easy bet; it also, however, encourages one to overlook a more complex and ambiguous reality that lurks beneath the surface. We might agree, for example, that markets confer myriad economic and political advantages. What we might less readily agree on, however, is what, precisely, we mean by &#8220;markets.&#8221; As the essays in MarketsinHistoricalContexts make clear, if we mean institutions that are &#8220;not encumbered by geography, weight, unequal access to information, government regulation, or particularistic agendas&#8221; (p. 226) (not to mention cultural context), then we will quickly find ourselves running afoul of social science's ultimate limit: reality.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705210149","149-150","Peter Lindsay","Georgia State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","658","169"

If Hartz's work gets him where he wants to go better than Judith Shklar's or Rogers Smith's does, that's fine.

Why are American unions as politically weak and numerically insignificant as they are? Beyond parties and movements, we must also seek to understand the absence in the United States of the public goods that are commonly associated with the emergence of social democratic parties in other countries: comprehensive and redistributive policies in the areas of welfare, housing, education, and health care.

Critiques allege two basic, related flaws: (1) Hartz&#39;s interpretation ignored the diversity in American political thought, particularly, though not exclusively, on questions of race, and (2) his analysis exaggerated the extent of the consensus in American political culture. These critiques are based almost exclusively on Hartz&#39;s analysis of selected periods of early American political development. I argue that Hartz&#39;s basic concepts are powerful analytical tools that continue to provide the most compelling analysis of recent American political development.

In this view, historians' accounts of the past are subjective narratives by default if not by design. Narratives can, it might be argued, be disproved&#8212;but factuality cannot be proved.

The puzzle is particularly stark in the case of the former Soviet Union: the multiethnic Russian Federation has managed to survive intact the transition from totalitarian rule, whereas the multiethnic USSR disintegrated. The critical distinction between the USSR and Russia lies in the design of ethnofederal institutions. The USSR contained a core ethnic region, the &#8220;Russian Republic,&#8221; a single region with a far greater population than any other in the union. This core ethnic region facilitated dual sovereignty, exacerbated the security fears of minority-group regions, and promoted the &#8220;imagining&#8221; of a Russia independent of the larger Soviet state. In place of a single core ethnic region, the Russian Federation contains 57 separate provinces. This feature of institutional design has given Russia&#39;s central government important capacities to thwart the kind of centrifugal forces that brought down the USSR.

In view of the voluminous and largely sanguine literature on American democratic responsiveness, one might assume that this policy turnaround was broadly consistent with voters&#39; priorities. In this article, we show that&#8212;in contradiction to this prevailing view, as well as the claims of Larry Bartels in this issue&#8212;the substance of the tax cuts was in fact sharply at odds with public preferences. Tax policy was pulled radically off center, we argue, by the intersection of two forces: (1) the increasing incentives of political elites to cater to their partisan and ideological &#8220;base&#8221;; and (2) the increasing capacity of politicians who abandon the middle to escape political retribution. In accounting for these centrifugal forces, we stress, as others have, increasing partisanship and polarization, as well as the growing sophistication of political message-control. Yet we also emphasize a pivotal factor that is too often overlooked: the deliberate crafting of policy to distort public perceptions, set the future political agenda, and minimize the likelihood of voter backlash. By showing how politicians can engineer policy shifts that are at odds with majority public preferences, we hope to provoke a broader discussion of voters&#39; capacity to protect their interests in America&#39;s representative democracy. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705050048","33-53","Jacob S.

Three out of every four people polled said that the difference in incomes between rich people and poor people has increased in the past 20 years, and most of them added that that is a bad thing&#8212;but most of those people still supported the regressive 2001 Bush tax cut and the even more regressive repeal of the estate tax. Several manifestly relevant considerations had negligible or seemingly perverse effects on these policy views, including assessments of the wastefulness of government spending and desires for additional spending on a variety of government programs. Support for the Bush tax cuts was strongly shaped by people&#39;s attitudes about their own tax burdens, but virtually unaffected by their attitudes about the tax burden of the rich&#8212;even in the case of the estate tax, which only affects the wealthiest one or two percent of taxpayers. Public opinion in this instance was ill informed, insensitive to some of the most important implications of the tax cuts, and largely disconnected from (or misconnected to) a variety of relevant values and material interests. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705050036","15-31","Larry M.

By Stephen A. Yetiv. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2004. 256p. $35.00.Steve Yetiv's central argument is that oil stability has improved in recent years in the sense that the market is resilient, enjoying a self-reinforcing equilibrium by its ability to deter, mitigate, and contain threats to supplies. The author explicitly distinguishes oil supply stability from oil price stability, as oil prices have become more volatile while supply volumes have stabilized. Implicitly, he argues that price flexibility stabilizes supplies and that the world oil market has become more competitive and less rigid, so that relations between oil exporters and importers have become more pragmatic and less politicized. Attention is on the physical availability of oil: Disruptions are unlikely, not on oil prices or their impact on incomes, inflation rates, and trade balances, but historically, oil has always been available in the world market, at a price. The book would have benefited from a more systematic elaboration of the key argument, early on.

Sandra Whitworth offers a critical eye and questions of gendered analysis by studying the subjects of the UN's peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, whose presence often meant greater insecurity as well as the (mis)conduct of soldiers from Canada&#8212;a country historically linked to major peacekeeping contributions&#8212;in Somalia. Using these two case studies, Whitworth highlights a basic contradiction inherent in peacekeeping that stems from its heavy reliance on soldiers whose training emphasizes masculine traits of violence, homophobia, racism, and aggression, yet whose tasks as peacekeepers require limiting violence to self-defense and providing a benign, altruistic presence. She uses gender analysis to examine these contradictions, to challenge peacekeeping's association with alternatives to military violence, to show how peacekeeping forces can increase local people's insecurity, rather than alleviating it, and to critique the use of soldiers for missions requiring unsoldierly skills.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705940255","696-697","Margaret P.

Conventional international relations literature focuses typically on the impact of knowledge on institutions. Virginia Walsh's interest, however, is to &#8220;turn the causal arrow&#8221; by focusing on the &#8220;institutional dimension&#8221; of knowledge creation: How do global political and economic, but also epistemic, institutions shape knowledge generation? (pp. 4&#8211;5, 38, 128, 130). Here, the scientific disciplines qualify as epistemic institutions (p. 34). From that point of departure, underscoring an institutional perspective, the emphasis concentrates on the &#8220;institutional mechanisms&#8221; through which knowledge is being formed. Groups leverage institutional mechanisms to &#8220;generate knowledge and fix beliefs&#8221; for the purposes of 1) establishing common understandings, 2) repairing uncertainties, and 3) directing inquiry by &#8220;fixing its direction&#8221; (pp. 3, 9, 38).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705930259","694-696","David F.

To answer this question, Kenworthy presents a careful comparative analysis of income inequality in the countries of northwestern Europe, North America, and Australia during the 1980s and 1990s. He shows that there is not necessarily a trade-off between equality and income growth, although there may be a trade-off between equality and some categories of employment growth. Hence, he argues that with an updated, pro-employment version of the welfare state, we need not give into growing disparity in advanced capitalist societies. Whether this will be desired by all and achieved remains to be seen; nevertheless, the book is an important antidote to the &#8220;there is no alternative&#8221; type of thinking that pervades much contemporary discourse on economic globalization.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270590025X","691-692","Peter V.

Today, in the post-9/11 world, deterrence has taken a back seat to a different set of strategic concepts: preemption and prevention.

Most of the works on this subject have a virtually standard organization involving a country-by-country breakdown of the most recent and most likely proliferators (India, Pakistan, Israel, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, etc.), according to their motives (why they want to go nuclear) and their capacity to do so, either by themselves or with the help of existing nuclear powers. The focus of these works is, therefore, on what often is called &#8220;horizontal proliferation,&#8221; having to do with the addition of extra members to the &#8220;nuclear club.&#8221; Regarding the Cold War superpowers, the United States and former USSR, there has been a largely separate literature devoted to &#8220;vertical proliferation,&#8221; and associated arms control measures and possibilities, in the context of nuclear deterrence theories and concepts.

He further argues that modern employment doctrine, which enables skilled ground forces to negate the effects of lethal fires against them, was born in late World War I, when attackers finally overcame entrenched defenses. A skilled operations research analyst of tactical battles, Biddle offers a multimethod approach that combines logical reasoning, case studies, mathematical models, statistical analysis, and dynamic simulations.

The issue could not be more general or more important. It is this question: Do members of the mass public actually have opinions about political issues? The question has been debated from the earliest work on public opinion, but was raised in a particularly stark form in a seminal paper by Philip Converse published in 1964. As is well known, he suggested that most people did not have meaningful opinions on most issues, due to the instability of their responses across different waves of a panel survey. The contributors to this volume are leading authorities in the field of political psychology and public opinion research, and the papers collectively make an important contribution to addressing this question. Paul Sniderman and John Bullock in the concluding chapter summarize the existing research agenda on this issue in the following terms: &#8220;The dominant themes of two generations of research have been that citizens tend to be muddle-headed (the lack of constraint theme), empty headed (the non-attitude theme) or both&#8221; (pp. 337&#8211;38).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705810254","680-681","Paul Whiteley","University of Essex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","601","149"

Reacting against the focus upon social structure that has been so prominent in the analysis of democratic and nondemocratic regime trajectories, she attempts to provide an explanation of the paths to the contemporary situations of three countries, France, Germany, and Russia. She argues that these cases contrast with one another in ways that help to illuminate a range of hypotheses generally accepted about the relationship between democracy, on the one hand, and such variables as economic crisis, economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization, on the other. In broad terms, she sees the cases contrasting in the following ways: Russia contrasts with France and Germany in respect to democracy, Germany with France and Russia in respect to revolution, and France with Germany and the Soviet Union in respect to totalitarianism.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705800258","679-680","Graeme Gill","The University of Sydney","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","654","191"

At the heart of the book is a reaction against the minimalist definitions of democracy that in the past two decades have come to dominate not just the regime literature but also the democracy promotion work of a whole host of external donors in what Guillermo O'Donnell calls the East and South. While more countries have been able to sustain minimally democratic political regimes than early pessimists feared, the paramount failings of democracy nevertheless have been of growing concern to academics and citizens alike. According to the argument advanced in this book, understanding the performance of these new democracies&#8212;and identifying strategies for strengthening democracy&#8212;requires that we move beyond regime type &#8220;toward other spheres where political power is exercised&#8221; (p. 1). In much of Latin America, for example, political regimes experienced democratization while many of the state's authoritarian legacies were maintained more or less intact. In addition to conceptualizing democracy in a richer and more complex way, the book goes on to show how this more comprehensive view of democracy can be measured and evaluated, which it does by describing an actual democracy audit in one important Latin American case: Costa Rica.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705790253","677-679","Kent Eaton","Naval Postgraduate School","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","908","447"

That trust is important to democratic transition is its central assumption, but only the final chapter asks whether it is true or why it should be. Instead, most of the chapters discuss how the communist experience affected relations of trust. But some chapters make claims about communist society that generalize solely from the Stalinist period, while others concern the experiences of particular countries to a point where the precise relationship to communism is left unclear. In the end, the only unifying aspect of the book is each chapter's discussion of some aspect of trust in relation to some aspect of the former Soviet bloc.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705750258","673-674","David Ost","Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","490","194"

In this book, editors Martin A. Levin and Martin Shapiro argue that policymakers on both the conservative and liberal side of the spectrum are so concerned about courting undecided voters who take a &#8220;middle of the road&#8221; stance that they often compromise bold or innovative policy initiatives in the name of moderation to attract these neutral voters. To complicate matters, most governments are facing austere conditions&#8212;which suggests that while demographic and political forces shape policymaking, economic variables play a pivotal role as well.

Ireland's study finds that belonging is context specific, rather than derived from common descent. This finding implies that there is by definition no readily available general policy applicable to one type of immigrants, say, Turks or Moroccans across all EU member states. Instead, each country's possibilities for integration differ. To Ireland, ethnicity &#8220;is not so much a category as a dynamic, elastic entity.

Voter turnout is one of the more frequently studied topics in political science, but the results of all these scholarly efforts remain rather poor and unsatisfactory. We still know distressingly little about why some people vote and others do not, why turnout is much higher in some countries than in others, and why in so many countries there seems to be a steady and irrevocable decline in turnout in national elections.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705670259","663-664","Joop J.

By Andrew Rudalevige. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002. 292p. $65.00.This book responds effectively to a theoretical challenge with an empirical analysis. The author addresses the proposition that successive presidents have increasingly centralized policy development in the White House to the detriment of the departments. The linear trend is said to be in response to the political demands on presidents to control their own programs. Andrew Rudalevige qualifies the theory out of existence by so broadening it that it disappears. He supplies a rich, empirical model in which presidents employ centralized, balanced, and decentralized approaches for developing policy as deliberate strategies as they perceive the different kinds of political capital and expertise involved in given cases. He finds no linear trend at all. All presidents since Harry Truman have used the White House to develop policies, but not to an increasing degree. Centralization is contingent.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705540258","649-650","Erwin C.

There, the author explicitly refers to the Court as the O'Connor Court since he determines that it is largely the blend of political conservatism and judicial moderation, long displayed by Sandra Day O'Connor, that encapsulates the modern Court. So the thesis is no more than stated as something of a straw man at the outset. Thomas Keck &#8220;reveals&#8221; that the political ideology (liberal/conservative) dimension of justices is not identical to the judicial activism/restraint dimension of their judicial perspectives.

Although that would seem to be logical, the author documents that many scholars who write about the Court do not share this thesis. Those scholars, such as the so-called attitudinalists, posit that oral arguments have no effect on justices' votes. In order to reinforce his thesis, Timothy Johnson uses the strategic model of decision making, namely, that justices are goal oriented, they are strategic, and they account for institutional rules. He then goes on to explain that because the briefs presented to the Court from both the litigants and from amici curiae are understandably biased in behalf of their particular points of view, the oral arguments serve to solve this problem.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705470255","642-643","Robert W.

Tobin Grant and Thomas J. Rudolph systematically examine attitudes toward campaign finance reform in a very interesting and compelling manner. In a thorough analysis, they examine the commitment citizens have to the competing democratic values of political equality and political expression, finding that opinion varies depending upon perceptions of whose rights are being threatened. The central thesis of the research, which is well established with a comprehensive literature review and theoretical analysis, is that public opinion on campaign finance reform is group-centric, a function of the views individuals have toward groups that are thought to be affected by the proposed reform. If individuals feel positively about a group that is seen as being threatened by the reform, they will be negatively inclined toward the reform. Conversely, if individuals view the group with suspicion or negativity, they will favor the reforms. The research represents a systematic analysis of public opinion on campaign finance reform on a nation level, examining the factors that impact opinions and the dynamic manner in which opinions are formed and maintained.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705440256","637-638","Joanne Connor Green","Texas Christian University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","871","238"

He sees it, along with media attention and poll rankings, as crucial in determining the viability and eventual success of candidates. The interrelatons of these factors can be seen in his three main hypotheses. Strong fund-raising predicts survival and &#8220;success in the early nomination process&#8221; (p. 11). Extensive early fund-raising organization and activity increase the possibility of success. Media coverage of these activities forecasts candidate viability and success.

By Diana Evans. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 280p. $60.00 cloth, $21.99 paper.A variety of recent studies of American politics and public policy focuses on the role of entrepreneurs in the agenda-setting process. While the focus is quite often on the role of entrepreneurs as architects of policy change, or as sources of policy disequilibrium (Frank R. Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones, AgendasandInstabilityinAmericanPolitics, 1993; Mark Schneider, Paul Teske and Michael Mintrom, PublicEntrepreneurs:AgentsforChangeinAmericanGovernment, 1995; Adam D.

(Although this might be the difference between entrepreneurial and leadership activity, the former is interested in assembling a coalition to challenge the policy status quo, while the latter focuses on coalition maintenance in support of the status quo.) Whether they are engaged in &#8220;creative acts of destruction&#8221; (Joseph Schumpeter, Capitalism,Socialism,andDemocracy, 1942) or are attempting to maintain a policy equilibrium, a major factor shaping the decision to pursue entrepreneurial activity, as well as the chances of success of such efforts, is the perceived costs associated with assembling a winning coalition.

By William Blomquist, Edella Schlager, and Tanya Heikkila. Washington, D.C.: Resources for the Future, 2004. 210p. $70.00 cloth, $30.95 paper.Water supply and allocation is a problem that has plagued the West for most of its history. Water marketing, a greater emphasis on conservation, and surface water augmentation projects are all methods that have been used to address the problem. Another approach that has been around for quite some time but has been pushed to the forefront in recent years is the idea of conjunctive use management. In its broadest sense, conjunctive use management is simply linking surface and groundwater together and managing them as a common water supply pool. Rather than having one set of groundwater users and one set of surface water users, all are bound together by the need for more water. By doing so, excess surface water can be stored beneath the ground during wet times, and these same users can draw on the underground supply during times of drought. Similarly, the storage will increase the amount of water available underground so that overdraft conditions are diminished. In theory, this means that there will be an overall gain in the amount of water available for all users and that supplies can be managed on a more sustainable basis. In practice, Wiliam Blomquist, Edella Schlager, and Tanya Heikkila point out, existing institutions play a major role in determining the push for conjunctive use management and the form that it takes.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705370253","630-631","Jeffrey S.

The author contends that current conceptual approaches to explaining organizational behavior, such as the availability of resources, or political opportunities, or &#8220;collective belief systems,&#8221; can fall short in their predictive powers. There are times, for example, when organizations appear to be irrational and self-destructive as they ignore &#8220;obvious political opportunities&#8221; or invest &#8220;resources inefficiently&#8221; (p. 6). Analyzing organizational behavior from the perspective of its &#8220;governance structure&#8221; or &#8220;political system,&#8221; however, &#8220;resolves many of these apparent inconsistencies&#8221; (p. 6).

By Davina Cooper.

In the social state, he explained, distinctions and subordinations are necessary, including those attached to &#8220;differences of condition.&#8221; Later, as the old order yielded to democracy, Tocqueville discerned an inexorable tendency toward the leveling of those very differences. Would it end, he wondered, in a new Caesaristic despotism in which an atomized populace, deprived of the protection of intermediate powers, is enslaved by an all-powerful ruler? In modern societies considered free, the march toward equality of conditions has stopped well short of this dead end. But how does the modern conception of equality square with ways of living that challenge prevailing social norms? That is the subject of this inquiry, which, somewhat ironically, aims to restate from a leftist perspective the case put by the Chevalier de Jaucourt for accepting some such differences.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705230256","613-614","Sanford Lakoff","University of California, San Diego","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","710","222"

He questions the view held by many contemporary political theorists that the development of civil society, understood as the realm of what Tocqueville called &#8220;voluntary associations&#8221; mediating between the individual and the state, is a necessary condition for the maintenance of liberal democracy. Against this position, Boyd argues that an earlier tradition of liberal thought was justifiably suspicious of the potential for subpolitical social groups&#8212;especially, but not limited to, intolerant religious sects&#8212;to undermine rather than support liberal institutions. In a series of well-argued chapters, he traces the trajectory of the connected ideas of civil society and social pluralism from initial suspicion to perhaps uncritical acceptance.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705210253","611-612","Louis Hunt","Michigan State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","866","256"

However, here the interest is in the degree to which growth and other things, most especially the quality of government, translate into standards of living and aspects of &#8220;human development&#8221; or &#8220;capability,&#8221; typically measured by school completion rates, child malnutrition, under age-five mortality, and related indicators. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Jennifer Widner is professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University (jwidner@princeton.edu).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705340345","572-575","Jennifer Widner","Princeton University (<a href=mailto:jwidner@princeton.edu>jwidner@princeton.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1676","312"

Although my arguments apply broadly, here I consider development, and so I focus on organizations such as the World Bank and IMF. Over the coming decades these organizations will fail in their attempts to alleviate poverty. On a more positive note, political science is rapidly advancing our understanding of the pathologies of IOs. Unfortunately, the failure of IOs to alleviate poverty is, I believe, a politically stable circumstance: intellectual advances will not translate into better-performing IOs. I focus on a specific set of theoretical arguments as to why IOs fail to promote development, concluding that we should anticipate more of the same rather than the radical reforms that are necessary if IOs are to achieve their stated goals. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Alastair Smith is professor of politics at New York University (alastair.smith@nyu.edu).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705310346","565-567","Alastair Smith","New York University (<a href=mailto:alastair.smith@nyu.edu>alastair.smith@nyu.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1159","589"

We conclude that the theoretical arguments that IR scholars advance do not show that a shift toward unilateralism necessarily has high costs.

I argue that social capital only assumes conceptual coherence when distinguished from its complementary opposite. I illustrate these theoretical points with a discussion of political reform in Thailand and the 2001 general election. The election exemplifies the benefits of the circulation of social capital: voter turnout and party membership were up, and civil society was active. Yet democratic achievements in Thailand were intimately tied to political corruption. In Thailand, democracy and vote buying are intimately related as examples of the productive dynamic of social capital and corruption; the civil and the uncivil often produce each other. This essay thus expands social capital theory&#39;s focus on the relations of people by examining the relationality of concepts. One has to examine the quality of social capital and the ethics of each network&#39;s inside/outside distinction. Thus rather than being a political solution, social capital is a theoretical problem, warranting further comparative research that examines how civil social capital interacts with the uncivil social capital of corruption, ethnocentrism, and sectarianism. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705050310","495-508","William A.

We observe sizeable increases in market household inequality in most countries. This development appears to have been driven largely, though not exclusively, by changes in employment: in countries with better employment performance, low-earning households benefited relative to high-earning ones; in nations with poor employment performance, low-earning households fared worse. In contrast to widespread rhetoric about the decline of the welfare state, redistribution increased in most countries during this period, as existing social-welfare programs compensated for the rise in market inequality. They did so in proportion to the degree of increase in inequality, producing a very strong positive association between changes in market inequality and changes in redistribution.

Sinclair makes a strong theoretical and empirical contribution to the growing political economy literature on the increasing influence of nonstate actors. More specifically, he draws upon a cogent interweaving of rationalist and constructivist approaches to reveal the various forms of power exercised by American bond raters, such as Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Moreover, by means of detailed case studies on the rating of corporations, municipalities, and national governments, he demonstrates the broad political implications of rating agency power in terms of both geopolitical and distributive questions. In both cases, Sinclair's central argument is that &#8220;rating agencies help to construct the context in which corporations, municipalities, and governments make decisions. Rating agencies are not, as often supposed, &#8216;neutral&#8217; institutions. Their impact on policy is political first, in terms of the processes involved, and second, in terms of the consequences of competing social interests&#8221; (p. 149).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705940498","956-957","Adam Harmes","University of Western Ontario","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1087","200"

The book provides detailed descriptions of U.S. policies that promoted better and worse human rights practices in particular countries over the past 30 years. She notes several cases where the U.S. government sent mixed signals by being strong on general human rights rhetoric, but by not pressing human rights concerns when dealing with Latin American governments facing domestic rebellions. The willingness of the U.S. government to support anticommunist, counterrevolutionary and antiterrorist policies has been much stronger than any desire to promote good human rights practices in the region.

Yet the phenomenon remains puzzling, for while many European liberals, especially from the mid&#8211;nineteenth century through the interwar period, enthusiastically promoted imperial rule, the reasons for their support varied widely: There is no single or consistent liberal imperialism. Jeanne Morefield has enriched this story considerably with her closely argued and elegantly written account of a hitherto largely neglected episode, which she calls &#8220;one of the most philosophically interesting moments when liberal thinkers and activists engaged in the politics of hierarchy and paternalism&#8221; (p. 2). Although Morefield's protagonists, Gilbert Murray and Alfred Zimmern, have not received much attention in previous scholarship, her narrative impressively complements the account in Martti Koskenniemi's recent book TheGentleCiviliserofNations (2002).

Expanding the central arguments of his previous study, TheGlobalizationSyndrome (2000), James Mittelman defines globalization as &#8220;a triangulated structure&#8221; comprised of &#8220;the global division of labor and power, a new regionalism, and resistance politics&#8221; (p. 5). Shifting his analytic focus from issues in international political economy to the cultural production of identities, Mittelman locates his primary concern in this concise collection in the &#8220;subjective framework of globalization, namely, knowledge and ideology&#8221; (p. 3). Thus viewing globalization as a &#8220;cognitive map constituted by clusters of knowledge,&#8221; the author focuses particularly on the production of alternative forms of knowledge, ideas, and strategies of resistance to globalization&#8212;&#8220;alterglobalization&#8221; (p. 97).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705900492","951-952","Manfred B.

New York: Routledge, 2004. 276p. $80.00 cloth, $27.95 paper.Can scholars of international relations dig themselves out from under the weight of several hundred years of world history and their own analytic baggage and remake themselves? This book asks for precisely this, delivering an important message for the discipline. Naeem Inayatullah and David Blaney's opening premise is that IR, in spite of what one might logically expect, has always in fact been stymied and wrong-footed by the &#8220;problem of difference.&#8221; Far from being able to understand and deal sensitively with diversity and the other, the practices and discipline of IR have squashed it&#8212;internally the state has become an engine of homogenization, while externally international society is a hostile realm of danger and hierarchy, in which forces of an &#8220;empire of uniformity&#8221; operate to stigmatize difference and tame it. Instead of embracing and theorizing difference, IR is associated from the time of early modern Europe with the crippling dual &#8220;legacy of colonialism and religious cleansing&#8221; (p. viii). The authors are advocates instead of &#8220;heterology,&#8221; of the study of IR as a &#8220;study of differences&#8221; in which dominant Western perspectives and leaders are not afraid to be challenged and changed by encounters with diversity and the other, in which such encounters are open questions.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705880491","948-949","Daniel M.

The two dominant IR paradigms&#8212;neorealism and neoliberalism&#8212;tend to neglect religion altogether, assuming that religious beliefs and institutions are an impediment to world order. To a significant degree, the skepticism about religion is rooted in the prevailing Western assumption that science and reason will make religion unnecessary in modern life. However, contrary to the prevailing wisdom, the world has not become more secular. Rather, religion has become more prominent in society, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. As a result, the leading secular IR paradigms have failed to take into account the religious dimension in international affairs.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705870495","947-948","Mark Amstutz","Wheaton College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","494","122"

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 316p. $75.00.The constructivist approach to the study of international relations seems to have become popular today. Evelyn Goh's book uses the constructivist approach to study one of the most dramatic events in the history of international relations in the twentieth century: Richard Nixon's rapprochement with China. The traditional orthodox interpretation of Sino-American relations views bilateral relations in the 1960s as an extension of hostility and antagonism that started in the early 1950s; Nixon's dramatic departure in the early 1970s resulted from his realistic calculation of American strategic interests and the assistance China might provide in counterbalancing the increasing Soviet threat. This book analyzes the Sino-American rapprochement from a different angle. By identifying and tracing, throughout the 1960s within the U.S. government, the changing perception of China and the idea of a new China policy associated with the rapprochement, Goh tries to answer the question of how the rapprochement could have been achieved, rather than why it happened in 1972.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705860499","946-947","Yufan Hao","Colgate University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","595","149"

Conventional wisdom has it that Yugoslavia's wars in the 1990s were typical &#8220;Balkan&#8221; wars emanating from primordial nationalisms, heavily laden with historical baggage and rich in potent myth and symbols. The easiest way to explain Yugoslavia's violent disintegration in the late twentieth century was to relapse into clich&eacute;-ridden accounts of base, primeval ethnic rivalries that hitherto had been contained by a combination of the restraints imposed by Tito's brand of communism and the exigencies of a polarized Cold War international system in which Yugoslavia inhabited a very particular space.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705850492","945-946","Spyros Economides","London School of Economics and Political Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","743","326"

While the earlier analyses of South Asia came primarily from those working on nonproliferation issues and regional conflict-prevention perspectives, the advent of overt nuclear weapon status of India and Pakistan presented IR scholars with the opportunity to explore a range of hypotheses about new nuclear powers. Was South Asia going to be able to take advantage of its backwardness/late entry into the deterrence game and learn from the considerable research and experience of the two superpowers during the Cold War? Were India and Pakistan as rational as the United States and the Soviet Union (if not more), and could they manage their rivalry without resorting to nuclear exchange? Will their overt nuclear weapons capabilities make India and Pakistan more careful in their responses to each other's provocative moves? Is a rivalry based in political ideology (like the U.S.-USSR one) more susceptible to rational decision making than a rivalry based in religious ideology (supposedly the primary basis of the India-Pakistan dispute)?

Such conflicts are not a new phenomenon. However, in the early twenty-first century, continuing degradation of the environment, coupled with ever-increasing pressures on resources due to an expanding population, has substantially increased the incidence of violent conflicts on environmental issues. Moreover, most of the present threats to peace are major intrastate conflicts (e.g., civil war and genocide) or ones that are occurring along ecologically fragile border regions, implying that researchers should concentrate on the regional or local level of analysis. At the same time, as the cause of such conflicts has risen on the political and discourse agenda, a corresponding large body of research has emerged, increasing our understanding of the ways in which environmental destruction can lead to conflict.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705810497","940-941","Dimitrios Konstadakopulos","University of the West of England, Bristol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","456","98"

By Roland Bleiker. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005. 224p. $27.95.This slim book combines six chapters and a conclusion in 124 pages. It intends to promote a new way of thinking about Korean security problems that &#8220;goes beyond conventional realist and state-centric approaches&#8221; (p. 1). The idea is not to offer new empirical insights but instead to focus &#8220;on underlying trends and conceptual challenges&#8221; (p. xlvi) in order to identify &#8220;broad patterns of conflict and possibilities for peace&#8221; (p. xlvi). The ethical aim is to promote dialogue based on an understanding that &#8220;the other's sense of identity and politics may be inherently incommensurable with one's own&#8221; (pp. xlii&#8211;xliii). In the case of this book, the incommensurable &#8220;others&#8221; are the two Koreas&#8211;North and South. The author's contention is that efforts toward peace have been periodically tried and always failed in the past because there has not been a sufficient acceptance of difference between North and South. Roland Bleiker is keen to stress that such an approach does not lead to political relativism but that it, in fact, makes for improved debates, such as over the ability to make more informed political choices between different political projects. Toward the end of the book he argues, for instance, that &#8220;[t]olerating different coexisting narratives does not prevent making judgments about their content or desirability&#8221; (p. 114).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705790496","937-938","Hazel Smith","University of Warwick","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","450","140"

In an ambitious extension of his previous work, Jeffrey D. Berejikian attempts to construct &#8220;a new set of theoretical propositions about international politics securely anchored to empirical research in cognitive psychology&#8221; (p. 2). In the tradition of Graham T. Allison's (1971) EssenceofDecision, Berejikian meticulously demonstrates the degree to which behavioral expectations regarding strategic interaction are tied to underlying conceptual models of decision making. He substitutes prospect theory's empirically grounded observations regarding framing effects and loss aversion for rational choice assumptions regarding invariance and net asset valuation. The result is a comprehensive cognitive model of state interaction that is capable of explaining preference reversals, risk acceptance, and nonmaximizing choice. The boldness of this enterprise more than compensates for minor flaws in execution.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705770493","935-936","William A.

Some chapters, including the conclusion, also attempt to explain the nature of the new government under Chavez. However, given the origins of the book in conference papers from 2000, the latter task is quite underdeveloped. A fuller analysis of the nature and structure of the Chavez government, now into the final year of its first full constitutional term, would have made the book all the more valuable.

As she succinctly puts it, &#8220;The central argument of this book is that variation in regional activism is explained not by differences in structural economic conditions but by differences in understandings of the economy, which, in particular institutional contexts, resulted in differences in the imagination of economic interests&#8221; (p. 11).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705670491","923-924","Juliet Johnson","McGill University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","467","75"

By Mark Hallerberg. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2004. 258p. $39.95.Why did nearly all European Union member states in the late 1990s succeed in reducing their budget deficits below the necessary 3% threshold in time to join the monetary union, after years of varied success at achieving fiscal discipline? Do the explicit criteria set out by the Treaty of Maastricht and the prospect of participating in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) fully explain the fiscal convergence seen in Europe prior to and immediately following monetary union? These are the questions that concern Mark Hallerberg's book. Rather than crediting the incentive of joining the euro zone, Hallerberg focuses on the domestic sources of fiscal reform since 1973. He argues that the Maastricht criteria were important in certain countries, especially in southern Europe. But to understand why virtually all states achieved a sufficiently low budget deficit to participate in monetary union, one must examine the competitiveness of the party system, the functioning of the electoral system, and the ideological coherence of the governing coalitions in individual countries. Domestic political factors offer a more nuanced, and ultimately more convincing, account of fiscal policy in Europe at the end of the twentieth century.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705650499","920-921","Hilary Appel","Claremont McKenna College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","436","112"

There are two barriers to development of the field. First, with the exception of taxation law and, possibly, divorce, comparative analysis of law is of little use to practicing lawyers. Second, as I discovered in a project on comparative rape law, it is difficult to gain access to the primary data sources, especially outside North America and Western Europe.

Joseph F. Zimmerman is the exception. Although this book is replete with an impressive number of citations, it is Zimmerman himself who has almost single-handedly rectified this state of affairs. His earlier publications on national&#8211;state relations, including federal preemption, federal mandates, and federal&#8211;state commissions, were the precursors to two comprehensive examinations of interstate relations. In InterstateRelations:TheNeglectedDimensionofFederalism (1996), Zimmerman laid out basic premises of interstate relations within the American federal system. In InterstateEconomicRelations, he expands considerably those premises, illustrates them with case studies of economic competition and cooperation among the states, and presents impressive evidence of the critical role of the U.S. Supreme Court as parameter-setting referee.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705600497","915-916","Sarah F.

Albany: State University of New York Press, 2005. 416p. $89.50 cloth, $29.95 paper.Anne Schneider and Helen Ingram have assembled 11 essays by scholars who examine how Americans' understandings of social groups shape both the process and substantive outcomes of policymaking. Explaining how such meanings are made and what they imply proves to be a challenge for the contributors to this edited volume. Because the central concepts here are rather amorphous&#8212;group entitlement and deservingness&#8212;much room remains for argument about how much of either quality the target groups enjoy. The stated purpose of the book, &#8220;to explain, examine, and criticize the social construction of deservedness and entitlement in public policy,&#8221; is useful and ambitious (p. 2). Though rich in descriptive content on topics such as Revolutionary War pensions, policies toward Japanese-Americans, housing discrimination law, welfare, and microenterprise development, most of the essays raise many more questions than they answer regarding how socially constructed meanings come to be, how they matter for policy development, and the conditions under which such understandings significantly matter.

Analysts accustomed to studying a relatively stable set of nationally comparable social programs had to begin asking new, and sometimes startlingly basic, questions about the kinds of benefits that state and local governments were providing, to whom they were providing them, and on what basis. As a result, research on U.S. poverty and welfare reliance suffered a major setback at precisely the time when the need to track policy outcomes became especially critical.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705540490","907-909","Laura S.

In the 1980s, he served as a litigator in the Environment and Natural Resources Division, and as an assistant to the solicitor general, in the Department of Justice. He has represented environmental groups and local, state, and federal governments in numerous cases before the Supreme Court. Given this extensive legal background, one might expect the book to be a dense treatise on environmental law. Yet it is written for a much broader audience, with an engaging narrative style that is accessible for those not trained as lawyers. It is also interdisciplinary, covering everything from ecological theory in the opening chapters to the historical, economic, and political contexts of environmental law in the United States. While this interdisciplinary effort is admirable, the strength of the book clearly lies in the author's legal interpretations. Political scientists will be less impressed with his discussion of topics like public opinion and interest group behavior. Yet what matters more than relatively minor shortcomings with respect to any one discipline is that Lazarus has produced an engaging and articulate book that strives to reach a broad audience beyond law schools. For this reason, TheMakingofEnvironmentalLaw would make a wonderful addition to upper-division and masters level environmental policy courses. It is not sufficiently theoretical for most doctoral seminars, but it certainly deserves a central location on the shelves of environmental policy scholars.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705530494","906-907","Craig W.

In this book, she shifts her attention to the United States. Aside from one chapter on the Wobblies, the focus is on the present. In both books, her emphasis is on the way in which the space for political engagement&#8212;&#8220;public space&#8221;&#8212;is constructed, sustained, controlled, or foreclosed. Her overarching theme is that theorists of democracy have paid far too little attention to the spatial conditions for democratic interaction. As she attempts to show in the present book, the privatization of public space&#8212;that is, the transformation of once-open downtowns into privately governed business improvement districts, the creation of privately governed gated communities in the suburbs and elsewhere, and the colonization of once-public space by private businesses&#8212;tends to insulate people from direct, physical encounters with people who are &#8220;different&#8221; or who may be attempting to persuade them to think otherwise about political issues.

In particular, scholars and the public alike view it as broken because it has become too political, too ideological, and therefore overly contentious. While some conclude that these circumstances have led presidents to choose second-rate nominees, the more dangerous effect of this process is that it may seriously undermine the legitimacy of the nation's highest court of justice. A great deal of evidence has been wielded to support these claims. However, Michael Comiskey lays out a case that the conclusions drawn&#8212;from both the legalist and the political schools of thought&#8212;do not mean that the process is broken.

By Lee Ward. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 470p. $90.00.This is a study of the origins and development of Whig political thought in England and America. James Tyrrell, Algernon Sidney, and John Locke all wrote during the Exclusion Crisis in England that ended in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Their common enemy was divine right absolutism and its chief spokesman, Sir Robert Filmer. Their common starting point was the premise of man's &#8220;natural liberty&#8221; as requiring political orders to be grounded in some form of consent creating constitutional limitations on power and justifying resistance to tyranny. The core of the study is an analysis of Tyrrell's Patriarcha,NonMonarcha, Sidney's DiscourseConcerningGovernment, and Locke's TwoTreatisesofGovernment. Lee Ward asks us to &#8220;imagine [these] foundational works &#8230; to be intellectual and philosophical genetic markers placed in the bloodstream of the tradition&#8221; of Whig political and constitutional thought in England and America (p. 325).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705400493","891-892","Eldon J.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004. 327p. $27.50.Loren Samons's book is a nuanced and perceptive history of classical Athenian democracy. Well organized and lucidly and convincingly written, the chapters of this book, devoted to elections and voting (Chapter 2), public finance (Chapter 3), foreign policy before and during the Peloponnesian War (Chapters 4&#8211;5), and national defense (Chapter 6), bring to light underappreciated aspects of Athens's democratic development. To offer only a few examples: Samons traces the roots of Athens's fifth- and fourth-century democracy to its sixth-century tyrannies, underscoring the important respects in which Athenian democracy came to resemble more egregious forms of tyranny. He tracks the emergence of a public treasury at Athens during the fifth century and shows how this shift in the practices and institution of property expanded both Athens's citizenry and its imperialistic tendencies over the course of the Peloponnesian War. He explores the effects of Athens's quest for empire on its domestic policies and, by way of a sustained but largely implicit contrast with Athenian militarism and foreign policy, he offers an unconventional and persuasive picture of fifth-century Sparta as less pathologically warlike than Athens.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705350493","884-885","Jill Frank","University of South Carolina, Columbia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1138","156"

The editors' intent is to offer an invitation to scholars interested in either Eric Voegelin or postmodernism to explore the common ground shared by a major twentieth-century political theorist and a fashionable school of thought. The implication is that Voegelin's work will be more widely considered if postmoderns see its merits, and likewise, postmodernism will benefit from Voegelin's rejection of modernity without abandoning ethical foundations.

He argues that whiteness is, unlike blackness, not an identity but an illegitimate source of political privilege. Whites have constructed U.S. democracy around conceptions of freedom, equality, and citizenship that shore up their political privilege in a fundamentally bipolar racial system. This racial system admits immigrants and other persons of color only by consistently and ever more surreptitiously subordinating blacks and furthering white empowerment. Olson directs his argument against the assumption that white racism lurks in the application of liberal principles, and not in the principles themselves. He argues that a prejudicial politics is built into U.S. democracy and concludes that ridding the system of racial politics requires altering our basic principles.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705330490","881-883","Cynthia Willett","Emory University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","734","122"

Yet most of us spend the majority of our waking hours at some form of work. That our relationship with our productive activity was a crucial component of our identity was a key theme of Marx's writings, while Hegel, among others, noted how our need to work also shaped our social maturity.

The editors rightly recognize that adoption is a social practice through which family and identity are explicitly shaped and regulated by social institutions.

On the one hand, it is admirably broad in its scope relating issues in the philosophy of mind, psychology, sociology and of evolutionary biology to politics and ideology. On the other, the anticipation of relating the new liberalism in England (nothing is said of Scotland and Wales) to European liberalism is not fulfilled. Instead, the crisis of European consciousness relates to quite different considerations. The period between 1870 and 1930, it is claimed, saw an unprecedented questioning of the cohesion between reason and enlightenment, especially in three fields of knowledge that provide the focus for MarginsofDisorder, social psychology, biology, and classical studies. The revolt against the enlightenment was manifest in the proliferation of fields of knowledge developing their own vocabularies and procedural rules, rendering them incommensurable with one another. Encyclopedic reason was undermined by self-interrogation and increasing specialization. In social studies, for example, there were doubts about the existence, or alternatively the apprehension, of a universal set of standards for social good. Max Weber saw rationality as relational and historical, and Emile Durkheim, Gaetano Mosca, and Vilfredo Pareto formulated issue-specific terminologies allowing systems of social behavior to be analyzed without reference to their truth values or moral functions. Such arguments, Gal Gerson contends, justified the exercise of power by elites for its own sake (p. 17).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705260498","873-874","David Boucher","Cardiff University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","535","64"

Her use of Aristotle in this regard resembles most closely that of Hannah Arendt, to whom she refers in her opening paragraph and whose treatment of work, action, and the vitaactiva would appear to have influenced Frank's discussion of the &#8220;work&#8221; of politics referred to in her subtitle. But in bringing out the Aristotle who &#8220;harbors democratic possibilities,&#8221; the author also draws support, as well as distinguishes herself, from scholars such as Martha Nussbaum, Stephen Salkever, Fred Miller, Arlene Saxonhouse, Mary Nichols, and Alastair MacIntyre, who have, in very different ways, sought the aid of Aristotle to inform contemporary political life. ADemocracyofDistinction thus engages a student of the ancient Academy in a serious conversation with the modern Academy. As Frank rightly says in closing, &#8220;Aristotle's ethical and political lessons are no less timely for us than they were for fourth century Athens&#8221; (p. 180). By her own admission, the lessons she draws may not represent the view of the &#8220;definitive Aristotle,&#8221; but they do represent, she suggests, his effort both to reform fourth-century Athens and to lay the ground for a timeless possibility: a &#8220;democracy of distinction&#8221; that she sincerely and earnestly seeks to promote (pp. 8, 139&#8211;42).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705250491","871-873","Susan D.

Indeed, it is arguable that the intense interest displayed in Berlin's account of pluralism owes much to the importance of this topic in contemporary moral and political philosophy. To some extent, even the Berlin of the classic and influential lecture &#8220;Two Concepts of Liberty&#8221;&#8212;which has for long constituted the inescapable starting point for any serious analysis of this ideal&#8212;is overshadowed by the Berlin who insists that the goods human beings pursue are inescapably plural, conflicting, and incommensurable.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705240495","870-871","David Archard","Lancaster University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","809","294"

This question is at the heart of WorkableSisterhood. Michele Tracy Berger offers one of the first studies of the development of critical consciousness and political participation of women of color who are HIV positive. All of the women she interviewed for her study have also struggled with drug abuse and engaged in sex work, and all have found a way to translate their experiences into a range of political actions designed to empower themselves and other women who face similar challenges. These activities include contesting the stigma associated with HIV-positive status, working &#8220;face-to-face&#8221; with other HIV-positive women, designing events and cultural projects to educate the wider community about HIV and about those living with HIV and AIDS, and advocating for social and economic changes that would help improve the lives of HIV-positive people (p. 12).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705230499","869-870","Nancy A.

By Seyla Benhabib. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 251p. $65.00 cloth, $23.99 paper.Between 1910 and 2000, the world's population more than tripled, from 1.6 to 5.3 billion. The number of persons who live as migrants in countries other than those in which they were born increased nearly sixfold, from 33 million to 175 million, and more than half of this increase has occurred since 1965. Almost 20 million of these are refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. In her book, Seyla Benhabib grapples with both the political and moral implications of this rapid increase in transnational migration, arguing that the central principles that shape our thinking about political membership and state sovereignty are in tension, if not outright contradiction, with one another. &#8220;From a philosophical point of view,&#8221; she writes, &#8220;transnational migrations bring to the fore the constitutive dilemma at the heart of liberal democracies: between sovereign self-determination claims on the one hand and adherence to universal human rights principles on the other&#8221; (p. 2). She argues for an internal reconstruction of both, underscoring the significance of membership in bounded communities, while at the same time promoting the cultivation of democratic loyalties that exceed the national state, supporting political participation on the part of citizens and noncitizen residents alike.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705220492","868-869","Catherine A.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004. 254p. $25.00 cloth.It may seem odd, given its title, but this is a book about friendship. The central problem of American democracy, according to Danielle Allen, is a lack of trust among citizens. For democracy to be stable, its citizens must feel confident that the obligations and opportunities of society are shared equitably. Yet majority rule is a breeding ground for distrust, particularly in a polity marked by race. Without trust, there is nothing to bind the minority and the majority together. The task of this book is to find ways for citizens to trust one another in these unsettled times. Doing so, Allen argues, requires developing habits of political friendship. The challenge of democratic politics, ironically, is to turn strangers into friends.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705210496","867-868","Joel Olson","Northern Arizona University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2038","247"

Even so, there has often been a consensus that quantitative and qualitative research share a &#8220;unified logic of inference;&#8221; that the differences between these &#8220;traditions are only stylistic and are methodologically and substantively unimportant.&#8221; All of the books under review here share these convictions. Yet the most remarkable feature of these works taken as a whole &#8212;and the focus of this review essay&#8212;is the more capacious view of the scientific enterprise on display. John Gerring's SocialScienceMethodology, David Collier and Henry Brady's RethinkingSocialInquiry, and Charles Ragin's Fuzzy-SetSocialScience all focus on aspects of the scientific process beyond the testing of hypotheses&#8212;science being &#8220;a systematic, rigorous, evidence-based, generalizing, nonsubjective, and cumulative&#8221; way of discovering the truth about the world (Gerring, p. xv). If science is the systematic gathering of knowledge, testing hypotheses&#8212;the central concern of statistical inference&#8212;is an important part of this. But it is only one part. Before we can turn to testing hypotheses, we must be clear about concepts, theories, and cases. And here both Barbara Geddes's ParadigmsandSandCastles and the Elmans' BridgesandBoundaries complement the other works by attending closely to these issues even when the larger goal remains the testing of theory. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> George Thomas is assistant professor of political science at Williams College (gthomas@williams.edu).

Typically associated with the idea that constitutions should recede in favor of the rule of one during crisis situations, Lincoln&#39;s actions have been used on one side as the implicit and even explicit basis of presidential claims to increased power and on the other side as the example par excellence of what presidents should not do. Taking issue with this conventional interpretation and continuing the more recent scholarly recovery of Lincoln&#39;s profound concern for constitutionalism, I explicate the principles that guided Lincoln&#39;s use of executive power during the Civil War. By drawing out the importance of political necessity as the basis for &#8220;prerogative&#8221; over and against both popular approval and unlimited constitutional powers, I show how this principle also provides an alternative perspective and even an antidote to the current scholarly debate concerning whether constitutions are better preserved by &#8220;Jeffersonian&#8221; or &#8220;Hamiltonian&#8221; prerogative. Lincoln&#39;s example also shows us that we should not legalize, regularize, or institutionalize those powers that may be necessary to avert a crisis. Perhaps most importantly, Lincoln&#39;s statesmanship teaches us that constitutions can moderate and limit discretionary executive power only if the people learn an attachment to their Constitution that does not come naturally to them. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705050450","801-816","Benjamin A.

Amish Rumspringa and the Quandary of Exit in Liberalism","The Amish are often cited as a paradigm illiberal group, mistrustful of and separated from the modern world. But the Amish practice of rumspringa complicates this common image. At age 16, Amish children are released from church strictures and given a year or more to &#8220;run around&#8221; in violation of Amish norms. Only after the opportunity to taste life with cars, electricity, alcohol, and rock and roll do Amish-raised teens decide whether to be baptized and enter the church. Consent must be express, never tacit: to paraphrase Locke, an Amish youth is born a member of no church. But is rumspringa a meaningful exit option? Are there plausible ways to make it more meaningful? What does this practice suggest about the debate between &#8220;toleration&#8221; and &#8220;autonomy&#8221; liberals, who divide over whether illiberal minority cultures ought to be accepted or somehow reformed? This paper brings a potent case study to the cultural rights debate and argues that both sides fundamentally err. While tolerance liberals tend to vastly underestimate what is required of a meaningful right of exit, autonomy liberals fail to appreciate how much intervention would be necessary to provide such a right. The Amish case suggests that the exit option is deeply flawed as the litmus test for whether and how minorities should be accommodated in a liberal polity. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705050425","745-759","Steven V.

He argues convincingly that humanitarianism is becoming politicized and that humanitarian organizations are becoming institutionalized. These changes speak to core conceptualizations by humanitarians of themselves and to their capacity to fulfill their most essential functions. Barnett appropriately draws attention to the unexpected, counterintuitive, and at times undesirable consequences of politicization and institutionalization, particularly for ethics and identity. Humanitarian organizations, he concludes, are now far more vulnerable to external control, to the ability of states to constrain their practices and principles. By implication, Barnett concludes, politicization and institutionalization produce negative consequences for humanitarianism.

Whereas once humanitarian actors attempted to insulate themselves from the world of politics, they now work closely with states and attempt to eliminate the root causes of conflict that place individuals at risk. Second, a field of humanitarianism has become institutionalized; during the 1990s the field and its agencies became more professionalized and rationalized. Drawing on various strands of organizational theory, I examine the forces that have contributed to these transformations. I then explore how these transformations have changed the nature of what humanitarian organizations are and what they do. In the conclusion I consider how the transformation of humanitarianism links to the relationship between international nongovernmental organizations and world order, including the purpose of humanitarian action and its distinctive function in global politics. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592705050401","723-740","Michael Barnett","Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, University of Minnesota (<a href=mailto:mbarnett@hhh.umn.edu>mbarnett@hhh.umn.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8969","4337"

We argue that a deeper understanding of institutions&#39; emergence, their working properties, and their effect on economic and political outcomes should begin from an analysis of cognitive processes. We explore the nature of individual and collective learning, stressing that the issue is not whether agents are perfectly or boundedly rational, but rather how human beings actually reason and choose, individually and in collective settings. We then tie the processes of learning to institutional analysis, providing arguments in favor of what can be characterized as &#8220;cognitive institutionalism.&#8221; Besides, we show that a full treatment of the phenomenon of path dependence should start at the cognitive level, proceed at the institutional level, and culminate at the economic level.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704000635","75-84","C.

Government policies can play a crucial role in this process, shaping the things publics believe and want, the ways citizens view themselves and others, and how they understand and act toward the political system. Yet, while political scientists have said a great deal about how publics influence policies, they know far less about the ways policies influence publics. In this article, we seek to clarify how policies, once enacted, are likely to affect political thought and action in the citizenry. Such effects are hard to locate within the standard framework of approaches to mass behavior, and they are generally ignored by program evaluators and policy analysts. To bridge this gap, we direct attention toward a long and vibrant, but underappreciated, line of inquiry we call the &#8220;political tradition&#8221; of mass behavior research. Drawing this tradition together with recent work on &#8220;policy feedback,&#8221; we outline a framework for thinking about how policies influence mass politics. The major types of such effects include defining membership; forging political cohesion and group divisions; building or undermining civic capacities; framing policy agendas, problems, and evaluations; and structuring, stimulating, and stalling political participation.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704000623","55-73","Suzanne Mettler","Is Alumni Associate Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University (<a href=mailto:sbmettle@maxwell.syr.edu>sbmettle@maxwell.syr.edu).","and Joe Soss","Is associate professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin&#8211;Madison (<a href=mailto:soss@polisci.wisc.edu>soss@polisci.wisc.edu).","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12022","3965"

While it has some affinities with libertarianism and modern conservatism, this approach places less emphasis on limiting the scope of governmental interventions and more on shaping their character.

One study showed that the number of environmental studies programs at four-year colleges and universities doubled between 1990 and 1995, and more are still being added. Political science departments frequently find themselves at the center of these new programs, and courses in environmental politics are often in high demand among students. The complexity and persistence of environmental problems is finally forcing the academy to recognize the importance of interdisciplinary research and teaching. Consider the case of global warming. It is impossible to discuss this issue intelligently from the perspective of any single discipline. Political scientists might illuminate certain facets of the debate, such as how national and international political structures create few incentives for policymakers to aggressively address the issue. But however important such insights might be, they are far too narrow to even begin to encompass the complexity of the climate change issue, which requires literacy in the discourses of other disciplines, including environmental economics, atmospheric research, and environmental ethics. After decades of suspicion in the academy about the intellectual rigor of interdisciplinary approaches, the persistence of complex environmental problems, and simply the rapidly growing cohort of scholars engaged in environmental research and teaching, is driving increasing acceptance of such approaches. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Philip Brick received the APSA's Pi Sigma Alpha Award for Outstanding Teaching in Political Science in 2000, and in 2004 he was named Outstanding Environmental Educator by the Environmental Education Association of Washington.

Once a discipline's practitioners have settled on the agenda, they must then determine what methods can best illuminate those topics. This essay argues that political science today needs to give higher priority to studies of the processes, especially the political processes, through which conceptions of political membership, allegiance, and identity are formed and transformed. To do this, we need to identify, to a greater extent than most political scientists have, the historical contexts of the conflicts and political institutions that have contributed to political identities and commitments, and our approaches must provide empathetic interpretive understandings of human consciousnesses and values. We cannot rely solely, or even predominantly, on efforts to identify abstract, ahistorical, and enduring regularities in political behavior such as those that prevailed during the behavioralist era of modern American political science. Nor can we depend primarily on approaches, ascendant in our discipline's more recent &#8220;rational choice&#8221; phase, that enhance our formal grasp of instrumental rationality. Those sorts of work can certainly offer important contributions, but in general they are most effective as elements in projects that rest extensively on contextually and historically informed interpretive judgments. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Rogers M.

The authors by and large agree on the nature of science and the variety of ways to do it, but they disagree on the most fruitful way to proceed at this moment. Granato and Scioli believe that we need to do more to test theories with data and to formulate theories that are based on data. We need, in their phrase, to consider the empirical implications of theoretical models (EITM).

They do so to their detriment because heeding the basic lessons of statistical inference can prevent serious inferential errors. Of particular importance is the use of conditional probabilities to compare relevant counterfactuals. A prominent example of work using Mill&#39;s methods is Theda Skocpol&#39;s StatesandSocialRevolutions. Barbara Geddes&#39;s widely assigned critique of Skocpol&#39;s claim of a causal relationship between foreign threat and social revolution is valid if this relationship is considered to be deterministic. If, however, we interpret Skocpol&#39;s hypothesized causal relationship to be probabilistic, Geddes&#39;s data support Skocpol&#39;s hypothesis. But Skocpol, unlike Geddes, failed to provide the data necessary to compare conditional probabilities. Also problematic for Skocpol is the fact that when one makes causal inferences, conditional probabilities are of interest only insofar as they provide information about relevant counterfactuals. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704040150","281-293","Jasjeet S.

It uses 21 case studies of civil war onset and avoidance to show the shortcomings in prominent rationalist models of civil war that rely heavily on economic variables. These shortcomings include measurement error, unit heterogeneity, model misspecification, and lack of clarity about causal mechanisms. Additionally, the greed/grievance distinction that underlies the economic models is misguided. This article analyzes civil war not as a discrete phenomenon, but rather as one phase in a cycle of violence. Economic models of civil war, however, rely on theories that cannot distinguish effectively between civil war and other forms of political violence. To explain civil war, we must explain why various and often conflicting micro-level motives combine to produce political violence with the characteristics that we attribute to civil war. If we cannot understand why we get civil war instead of other forms of organized political violence, then we do not understand civil war. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704040149","259-279","Nicholas Sambanis","Nicholas Sambanis is assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at Yale University (<a href=mailto:Nicholas.Sambanis@yale.edu>Nicholas.Sambanis@yale.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13222","3981"

This article examines the reasons behind the Court&#39;s revival of federalism and the controversy it has produced. The first part reviews the normative jurisprudential debate over the Court&#39;s role as it has been cast in the legal academy. In the second part, we turn to an historical-empirical, or &#8220;political regimes,&#8221; framework for understanding the role of the Supreme Court. Although this framework provides a better explanation of the Rehnquist Court&#39;s foray into federalism, the connections between this approach and normative jurisprudential debates remain important, and we explore them in the final section. The Court&#39;s recent jurisprudence on federalism reflects both consensus and division within the current political regime&#8212;consensus that federalism is an important value, but division over how best to protect that value. We argue that competing jurisprudential theories over the role of the Court illustrate these political divisions. Thus, this article highlights the special insights political scientists bring to the subject, but also demonstrates how the two approaches can be usefully combined to provide a more robust understanding of the Court&#39;s role in the American political system. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704040125","233-248","J.

GettingItDone further examines how regime participants continue to negotiate rules after the ink has dried on their foundational agreements. In doing so, the volume serves as a helpful reminder that regimes evolve in response to changes in the international and domestic environments. Gauging the effectiveness or strength of a regime, as these authors suggest, requires analyzing the negotiations that occur after a regime is established and evaluating whether, indeed, the collective action problem the regime was intended to resolve is being resolved.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270493037X","643-644","Ren&eacute;e Marlin-Bennett","American University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1186","185"

By P. W. Singer. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2003. 368p. $39.95.Peter Singer has produced a highly commendable volume for the Cornell Studies in Security Affairs series on an area of study that has received relatively little attention within the academic world. Much of the existing literature focuses on the mercenary end of private military companies (PMCs) and ignores the breadth of the industry. Similarly, the debate on transformation has tended to focus on technology and changing approaches to the conduct of war; relatively little has concerned itself with the increasing role of the privatized military companies, yet, as Singer points out, 1 in 10 of those deployed by the United States in the most recent war in Iraq was a contractor. It is not just the scale of the industry at present (one estimate puts it at $100 billion per year) that makes it an important area for study. It is also that this industry covers the full spectrum of defense activities. It ranges from service provision at home to the provision of combat services and military units. This will become even more so as we move away from the linear battlefield and the idea of a front line melts away. Moreover, this is not just a Third World issue; virtually every state uses elements of the industry, with the United States being the largest user.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704920373","642-643","Andrew M.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003. 316p. $65.00 cloth, $23.00 paper.Like heavyweight boxers at the end of a round, the disputing sides in the debate over China's rise have retreated to their respective corners. In one corner are those who stress China's peaceful dispositions in development and consider the country a stable actor in regional security. In the other corner are those who claim that behind the fa&ccedil;ade of Chinese pacifism lies a strong desire for the fulfillment of &#8220;rich country and strong army&#8221; and &#8220;revolutionary political culture&#8221; embedded in the Chinese variant of Marxism-Leninism, and who therefore perceive the country as a potential challenger to the current pecking order of power. These dichotomous views are partially rooted in the two divergent interpretations of China's strategic culture in its use of military force&#8212;a nonviolent, defensive, accommodationist, idealized Confucian-Mencian paradigm symbolized by the Great Wall, and a zero-sum, offense-oriented, violent &#8220;hard realpolitik&#8221; (&#8220;parabellum&#8221;) paradigm as illuminated particularly in Alastair Iain Johnston's (1995) CulturalRealism.

Some explore the origins and development of a particular methodological approach to the study of politics, such as behavioralism or public choice. Others place developments in political science in a broader political and cultural context, such as progressivism or liberal reformism. Oftentimes such reflections are laudatory, championing the wisdom that has accrued in the discipline over time. Every so often, however, a critical voice is raised, not only questioning the empirical work being done in the field but challenging the assumptions upon which such work is based.

Realism thus predicts rapid and comprehensive diffusion of military methods, with all quickly emulating the state of the art as demonstrated by the strongest.

New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 392p. $75.00 cloth, $28.00 paper.This book is a highly ambitious attempt to provide a general theory on the self-sustainability of democratic federal systems of government. The authors' central hypothesis is that federal states can reach an equilibrium when both state- and federal-level political actors have an incentive to make electoral and other concessions in order to maintain the federal order. In contrast to unitary states, however, the central design feature of federations is not how best to create institutions that ensure that elected politicians faithfully serve constituent interests, but rather the opposite: How can institutions be designed in such a way that the politicians can become imperfect agents of the voters? For if the federation is to evolve into a stable polity, state-level elected representatives must persuade their voters that their interests must be put to one side, at least in the shorter term, because of the sacrifices involved in ceding power to the federal government. Similarly, federal-level politicians have to persuade their constituents to grant policy and other concessions to state governments.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704820371","631-632","David Mckay","University of Essex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1493","219"

First, Davis persuasively argues that complex international institutional factors can alter domestic protection of agriculture. Using the European Union and Japan as cases and marshaling sophisticated statistical evidence, she details historical patterns by which agricultural policy became linked to wider issues and, in the process, allowed trade liberalization to overcome the political advantages that small, well-organized groups, such as farm interests, possess. Second, she documents the contingent character of the politics of trade negotiations.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. 352p. $49.95.In November 2002, Turkey's Justice and Development Party (AKP) won the majority of the votes in the general elections and formed the government. AKP's electoral victory was a major development in Turkish politics, one that was the culmination of the growing importance of Islamic identity since the 1980s, but it also reflected the impact of the liberalization of the country's economy and politics in the 1990s. AKP was formed by a breakaway faction of the main Turkish Islamic political movement, disavowing that movement's more contentious Islamic demands in order to adopt a moderate and democratic platform. The meteoric rise of a party with origins in Islamic activism in the most secular Muslim country, one that has served as the paragon for secularism across the Muslim world, is a member of NATO, and is an aspirant to membership in the European community, has raised a number of interesting questions. There is much in the example of Turkey that is instructive for the study of Islamic activism, but there has so far been a dearth of studies on the subject.

It operates on three levels, the national, the European, and the global, and has three distinct (albeit related) objectives. The first objective is to chart the courses that the three main types of European capitalism (liberal, state, and managed) have taken since the 1970s, and then to detail the pressures that have pushed these &#8220;national capitalisms&#8221; along these different paths. The second objective is to bring the European Union back into discussions of the European political economy. This may seem a surprising objective given the vast amount of ink spilled on the EU in general, but Vivien Schmidt attempts to disaggregate the effects of &#8220;Europeanization&#8221; from those of &#8220;Globalization&#8221; and thus give a more nuanced account of the pressures facing European states.

By Maria Guadalupe Moog Rodrigues. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2004. 195p. $57.50 cloth, $18.95 paper.This book brings a new angle to the study of transnational advocacy networks (TANs) by making local choices, priorities, and outcomes the central focus of its analysis. TANs link actors at local, national, and international levels in campaigns across national boundaries. As Maria Guadalupe Moag Rodrigues points out, most such studies have focused on the campaigns' impacts on governmental policies or on public opinion. Her focus is on a network's influence on a part of itself instead. Are local participants empowered by TANs to formulate their own autonomous conceptions of sustainable development and to gain institutionalized mechanisms to articulate those? To answer these questions, a focus on the internal dynamics of politics, resources, cohesion, and legitimacy in the network becomes central. This is not a wholly new approach and is actually quite common in other fields, but does represent a departure from many studies of similar phenomena in political science. Rodrigues argues that it is especially important to look at the impact on local network members because that is central for local outcomes.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704730376","621-622","Kathryn Hochstetler","Colorado State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1406","255"

In her highly original and thought-provoking book, Debra Javeline argues that the relative quiescence of Russian workers can be explained parsimoniously: In the face of the complexities of post-Soviet political and economic transition, workers could not collectively decide who was to blame for wage arrears, and hence could not organize effective protests against any particular individual or institution.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704680376","615-616","Stephen E.

A country with a huge population&#8212;many living in rather grim circumstances of illiteracy, poverty and despair, bearing a historical legacy of hegemonic rule under the Mughals or the British, and professing a traditional culture marked by deference to authority and hierarchic social arrangements&#8212;does not present ideal conditions for democracy to flourish. But India confounded many pundits simply by surviving, indeed succeeding, as a pluralist and constitutional polity. However, one development that may be undermining that confidence is the emergence of an aggressive religious movement coalescing around the sanghparivar (i.e., the cluster of organizations dedicated to the principles of Hindutva), the extremist Hindu identity movement whose electoral success and social agenda is threatening to unravel one of the cherished pillars of India's democracy&#8212;its self-conscious and determined commitment to a secular order.

Anil Hira addresses these important questions in his detailed analysis of the evolution of energy policy in the Southern Cone. The book is divided into five chapters that include an introduction, a chapter outlining the author's theoretical framework, one analyzing the domestic efforts to liberalize energy markets, one addressing regional integration, and a concluding chapter with suggestions for improving regulations in the energy sector. He concludes that the state continues to play an important role in shaping energy policy throughout the region, and the role of the state, either through state-owned enterprises or through regulation of the energy market, continues to exert an enormous influence over pricing, reliability, and investment. Furthermore, Hira argues that regional integration, which requires interstate cooperation, is essential in order to enhance the ability of Southern Cone economies to compete in the global marketplace.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704650377","612-613","Gregg Johnson","State University of New York at Buffalo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","989","140"

By Carlos A. Forment. Chicago: Chicago University Press, 2003. 488p. $35.00.Carlos Forment has produced a highly original, intriguing, and thoroughly researched exploration of civic behavior in Latin America from the mid-1700s through 1900. He presents the provocative argument, contrary to much past research, that citizen democracy, &#8220;understood in Tocquevillian terms as a daily practice and form of life rooted in social equality, mutual recognition, and political liberty, was by the mid-nineteenth century rooted in the region&#8221; (p. xi). This book cites numerous examples and scholarship from many parts of Latin America, but Forment provides detailed evidence from Mexico and Peru. As he argues in his introduction, Latin American forms of democracy are characterized by four qualities. First, democracy is disjointed because those forms that do exist are found among individual citizens, and not between citizens and governmental institutions, which essentially imposed an authoritarian structure on society. Second, he believes that the practice of democracy is one-sided, given his evidence that it is practiced in civil society rather than in political or public life. Third, it is highly fragmented, given the failures in Latin America to meld social equality and cultural/ethnic differences. Fourth, he claims that Catholicism provided the language of public life, and that Latin Americans used it to create new democratic meanings from traditional religious terms, which he labels &#8220;Civic Catholicism.&#8221;<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704630374","610-611","Roderic Ai Camp","Claremont McKenna College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1172","122"

The 1968 Act made housing discrimination against individuals because of race, creed, color, and national origin illegal. The 1977 Act was aimed at preventing credit discrimination (redlining) against geographical areas within cities. Sidney argues that the type of local groups that emerge to influence enforcement, and the strategies they utilize, are shaped by the resources built into the legislation's policy design, as well as by local political conditions.

This is a book written in the post&#8211;Oklahoma City period and is not primarily informed by post-9/11 concerns. It is largely descriptive and historical. Although it does make use of interest-group theory at points, this work is not organized around any specific social scientific theory-building agenda. George Michael provides a detailed survey of right-wing extremist groups and their activities (to include terrorism), as well as an account of the efforts of both the government and a wide array of private interest groups to resist and undermine their efforts. Perhaps most notable and interesting are 20 interviews Michael conducted with actors on all sides of this struggle (including William Pierce, chairman of the neo-Nazi National Alliance, and author of the novel TheTurnerDiaries, which served as a blueprint for McVeigh).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704540379","600-601","Thomas F.

By Paul M. Kellstedt. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. 155p. $60.00 cloth, $20.00 paper.The literature on race and public opinion has been dominated by the debate between those who emphasize the continuing role of prejudice or racial resentment and those who emphasize the role of other values and ideologies, such as limited government or individualism, in explaining sources of individual-level support and opposition to current race policy. Thus, it is refreshing to find a book like TheMassMediaandtheDynamicsofAmericanRacialAttitudes, which looks at racial attitudes from a different perspective. In the tradition of Howard Schuman and his colleagues in RacialAttitudesinAmerica (1997), Paul Kellstedt demonstrates and explains variation in the American public's racial policy preferences over the last half of the twentieth-century. Kellstedt draws on the existing opinion and media effects literature to develop a theory that can explain how the public as a whole evolves on matters of race. This book's most valuable contribution comes from the specific attention he gives to media framing. Many researchers suggest a role for media coverage in the development and trajectory of racial policy preferences over this period, yet little empirical work examines this relationship. Using an innovative approach, the author provides convincing evidence that media coverage &#8220;is an important part of a system of influences that determine public opinion on race in America&#8221; (p. 134).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270451037X","597-598","Kimberly Gross","George Washington University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1779","325"

He suggests that these trends originate in separate causes, but their coming together at the same point in history means that the potential for racial and ethnic tension may be heightened just as our capacity to cope with them have diminished (p. 3).

One source of this downward spiral lay in the dwindling novelty of studying pre-adults. Political scientists are accustomed to dealing with the &#8220;real world&#8221; of politics, one occupied and ruled by adults. After a prolonged lull, research began to increase in the 1990s and has continued onward. One driving force in this renewal stems from the decline in civic virtue among upcoming cohorts said to characterize most Western countries. A second influence was the crumbling of the former Soviet Union and the appearance of transitional and new democracies around the globe. In an effort to understand each of these developments and to propose possible solutions, a variety of institutions and scholars have returned to the question of citizenship development, often with the intention of improving the inculcation of civic virtue among the young.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704480372","594-595","M.

By Evan Gerstmann. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003. 236p. $60.00 cloth, $22.00 paper.One hundred and twenty years ago, the Congress of the United States was embroiled in a debate over how best to regulate a type of marriage that appalled most Americans. Republicans were making political capital out of their vigorous and vitriolic attacks against the idea of such marriages, while Democrats were looking for a way to finesse the issue to maintain the political support of the unpopular minority believing in such marriages without offending the majority. Laws were introduced and passed prohibiting these marriages. Fearing that a law would be insufficient, however, a constitutional amendment was proposed to ban such marriages. The Supreme Court upheld the right of states to criminalize such marriages, though it was never asked to rule on the right of a state to recognize such marriages. Persons wishing to enter such marriages were advised to go to a neighboring country that would recognize the legitimacy of their unions. In the 1880s, the issue was polygamy, the unpopular minority Mormons, and the neighboring country Mexico (see Edward L. Lyman, PoliticalDeliverance, 1986). Today same-sex marriages between gays or lesbians, some marrying in Canada, are causing as much turmoil in Congress as the issue of polygamy did then.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704470376","593-594","Charles W.

Rather than a mere case study in a field highly populated by such analyses, it is an ambitious attempt to critically assess competing midlevel theories of regulatory change and macrolevel determinants of policy change. As Alexander George has observed, case studies are extremely valuable, not because they test theories but because they clarify, offer critical insight into, and generate hypotheses for future research on those theories. Viewed from this perspective, Brainard's book provides a strong basis for deeper examinations of change in the regulatory and the broader policy process.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704450373","591-592","Richard Harris","Rutgers University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1137","150"

This literature largely ignores &#8220;mainstream&#8221; nonprofit organizations (those covered by section 501c3 of the federal tax code), however, though these organizations serve a substantial&#8212;and substantially disenfranchised&#8212;sector of society.

Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2004. 280p. $60.00 cloth, $26.95 paper.Arguments against remote Internet voting typically point to concerns over access and security. Despite the growth of the medium over the past decade, sizable portions of the U.S. population still lack home access. Moreover, the patterns of Internet access generally reflect the patterns of voter participation in the country; higher income, higher educated, and white citizens connect to the medium and vote at the highest rates. Therefore, the introduction of remote Internet voting likely would reinforce current participatory inequities. The other major concern, security, challenges the fitness of Internet voting even if the United States achieves universal access. Denial-of-service attacks and viruses may disrupt the transmission of ballots, and hackers may change votes already cast by getting past the system's fail-safe mechanisms. In short, most policy reviews agree that the time for remote Internet voting has not yet arrived; federal and state governments should focus their near- and medium-term developmental initiatives on electronic voting or secure kiosk Internet voting, rather than on remote Internet voting.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704410378","586-588","Brian S.

Bringing Marx's critical thoughts on race to bear on Tocqueville's vision of America as the &#8220;absolute democracy,&#8221; this book focuses on the fascinating question of why Tocqueville and Marx saw America in such radically different ways&#8212;as the vanguard of democratic equality, on the one hand, or as the epitome of racial inequality, on the other.

Many contemporary liberals defend cultural rights for cultural minorities while insisting that their practices conform to fundamental liberal values or demands of citizenship.

In it, Jenny Edkins explores the relationship between violence, the traumatic effects of violence, and the foundation and perpetuation of sovereign power. Using historical and field research, Edkins examines sites and practices that commemorate famines, wars, genocides, and terrorist attacks. She describes the evolution of the Cenotaph in Great Britain and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC; Dachau and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum; and the place of the &#8220;camp&#8221; (concentration camps at midcentury; refugee camps at the millennium) in political discourse.

Bush on election day in Florida. George W. Bush is president because he overcame his election day deficit with overseas absentee ballots that arrived and were counted after election day. In the final official tally, Bush received 537 more votes than Gore. These numbers are taken from the official results released by the Florida Secretary of State&#39;s office and so do not reflect overvotes, undervotes, unsuccessful litigation, butterfly ballot problems, recounts that might have been allowed but were not, or any other hypothetical divergence between voter preferences and counted votes. After the election, the NewYorkTimes conducted a six-month investigation and found that 680 of the overseas absentee ballots were illegally counted, and almost no one has publicly disagreed with their assessment. In this article, we describe the statistical procedures we developed and implemented for the Times to ascertain whether disqualifying these 680 ballots would have changed the outcome of the election. These include adding formal Bayesian model averaging procedures to models of ecological inference. We present a variety of new empirical results that delineate the precise conditions under which Al Gore would have been elected president and offer new evidence of the striking effectiveness of the Republican effort to prevent local election officials from applying election law equally to all Florida citizens. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704040332","537-549","Kosuke Imai","Kosuke Imai is assistant professor in the department of politics, Princeton University (<a href=mailto:kimai@Princeton.edu>kimai@Princeton.edu)","and Gary King","Gary King is the David Florence Professor of Government, Harvard University (<a href=mailto:king@harvard.edu>king@harvard.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2884","445"

This was primarily due to defective election administration in the state, especially the failure to use a system to warn each voter when too many marks were on a ballot and allow the voter to make corrections. If the best type of vote tabulation system used in Florida in 2000&#8212;precinct-tabulated optical scan ballots&#8212;had been used everywhere in the state, Gore would have won by more than 30,000 votes.

Minority voters are less likely to have their votes properly recorded with punch card systems than are nonminorities. This racial gap occurs, for the most part, because punch card systems lead to higher rates of &#8220;undervoting&#8221; by minorities. When election administrators switch to other systems, such as optical scan systems, the racial gap is significantly reduced. Punch card voting systems, then, constitute a disproportionate obstacle to minority voting. This effectively gives less weight to votes cast by minorities than to votes cast by nonminorities, and arguably violates constitutional requirements for equal voting rights.

It also opens prospects for a theoretically integrated agenda for empirical and normative political research. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704040253","459-473","Ruth Lane","Ruth Lane is associate professor of political science in the Department of Government, School of Public Affairs, at American University (<a href=mailto:rlane@american.edu>rlane@american.edu).","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3278","485"

The Political Representation of Identity Groups","Some 50 countries officially allocate access to political power by gender, ethnicity, or both. Yet in the world&#39;s electoral democracies, the policies used for women differ systematically from those used for ethnic groups. The former receive candidate quotas in parties; the latter, reserved seats in legislatures. Why? My explanation focuses on the varying ways that gender and ethnic identities intersect with partisan cleavages and on the distinct &#8220;work&#8221; performed by the different remedies for underrepresentation. Quotas, which make space within existing parties, are appropriate for groups whose boundaries crosscut partisan divisions. Reservations, which create incentives for the formation of group-specific parties and permit them direct representation, suit groups whose boundaries coincide with political cleavages. Since gender is crosscutting while ethnicity tends to be coinciding, women receive candidate quotas while ethnic groups get legislative reservations. Claims for inclusion via quotas pose less of a challenge to liberal institutions than claims to difference through legislative reservations. Case studies of representational politics in France, India, and Peru illustrate the argument. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704040241","439-458","Mala Htun","Mala Htun is assistant professor of political science at the New School for Social Research (<a href=mailto:htunm@newschool.edu>htunm@newschool.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12884","4028"

Ka Zeng advances (and generally sustains) an important thesis: that in trade disputes, U.S. policy has been tougher and more effective toward advanced industrial democracies (Europe, Japan) than nondemocratic nations (esp. China). The reason, she argues, lies in the structure of the economic relationships. Trade between the United States and the democracies is largely &#8220;competitive,&#8221; with industries and sectors going head-to-head for markets. The trade pattern with autocracies (and less-advanced economies like India and Brazil) is more &#8220;complementary,&#8221; with imports from these countries largely in product areas U.S. producers have abandoned.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704880587","903-903","I.

Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2003. 344p. $80.00 cloth, $25.95 paper.In 2001, Richard Sobel published four case studies chronicling the impact of public opinion on U.S. foreign policy since the start of the Vietnam War. He used public opinion surveys and interviews with senior policymakers, including three secretaries of state and four secretaries of defense, to document how opinions fluctuated throughout each crisis and how various movers and shakers felt about the weight that they should assign to public opinion in their deliberations. The crises&#8212;the Vietnam War, the Nicaraguan Contra-funding controversy, the Persian Gulf War, and the Bosnia crisis&#8212;demonstrate that public opinion did constrain policy options, but did not determine the specific policies that were chosen. This finding confirms V. O. Key's theory, first expressed in his pathbreaking study PublicOpinionandAmericanDemocracy (1961) that public opinion operates like a system of dikes.

For scholars, a theory of European foreign policy has not enjoyed the attention paid by theorists to internal economic integration (neofunctionalism), interstate bargains struck at intergovernmental conferences (realism, liberal intergovernmentalism), and the impact of ideas, preferences, identities, and interests (constructivism) that influence institutions.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704860584","901-902","Roy H.

Demonstrating the inadequacy of nation-state-based or international-centric responses to this question, it makes a case for conceptualizing globalization as a historically novel form of transnational capitalism. World capitalism, William Robinson argues, has undergone an &#8220;epochal change&#8221; involving not just a quantitative intensification but also a qualitative reconfiguration of economic, political, and social processes that were hitherto largely international. Taking advantage of technological developments and organizational innovations, capital has liberated itself from the social and political constraints imposed on it by nation-states and reorganized&#8212;fragmented and decentralized&#8212;the production process on a transnational basis. This reorganization of the productive base has gone hand in hand with the emergence of a transnational capitalist class (TCC), a transnational state apparatus, and a transnational ideological project.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704830585","897-898","Himadeep Muppidi","Vassar College","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1757","312"

Globalization is the independent variable used to explain changes in governance policies and institutions at the national level.

Realists apply these psychological characteristics to nation-states, modifying them only to the extent that states and their leaders are likely to be more rational&#8212;in the sense of being strategic and utility maximizing&#8212;than average people.

Regardless of one's alignment or identification with these groups, this finely edited volume is illuminating, and its high quality makes it relevant to scholars, decision makers, and interested members of the public. Support for this recommendation is found in the careful scholarship that runs throughout and in the firsthand experience of many of the authors with the topics and controversies they analyze and present.

In the first two chapters, the author carefully lays out his theoretical expectations concerning the conditions that make pivotal deterrence 1) possible, 2) probable, and 3) likely to succeed. A set of necessary conditions expected to make pivotal deterrence possible are clearly outlined: The two adversaries must see each other as more threatening than the pivot, whereas the pivot must be at least equal in power to them, prefer the status quo between them, and believe that both adversaries are revisionist and willing to go to war if assured of its support.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704770589","889-891","Vesna Danilovic","Texas A&amp;M University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1288","113"

In particular, scholars have contended that China's combination of capitalist markets with socialist purchasing and marketing organs provided opportunities to gain rents by taking advantage of discrepancies between the two price mechanisms. Officials gain from such a pattern of rent seeking, which tends to stall reform efforts. Somewhat paradoxically, Andrew Wedeman argues that economic rents propelled China toward a free market economy, a novel contribution to the debate on postsocialist transitions.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704720587","883-885","Scott Wilson","Sewanee: The University of the South","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1713","268"

After decades of submission in a highly centralized and authoritarian system, resurgent regions emerged as autonomous actors, threatening the territorial integrity and political stability of the newly independent Russian state. With the notable exception of Chechnya, Russia's regions eventually were reintegrated with the center, but on the basis of an asymmetrical federal system.

After reading and writing social and political history for over five decades, its author is well positioned to judge which social scientific understandings of democracy hold up to historical scrutiny and which do not. In his search for the &#8220;mechanisms and processes that promote, inhibit or reverse democratization&#8221; (p. ix), Tilly identifies a number of false leads. One of his most contentious points is that the quest for democracy's &#8220;necessary and sufficient conditions&#8221; is futile (p. 39). Democracy, he insists, &#8220;does not have a single history &#8230; repeated in more or less the same conditions and sequences by each democratizing country&#8221; (p. 35). Searching for either uniform conditions or repeated sequences is, thus, a waste of time. In an equally contentious mode, he cautions &#8220;culturalists, phenomenologists, behaviorists and methodological individualists&#8221; not to &#8220;treat individual dispositions as the fundamental causes of social processes.&#8221; Democratization and de-democratization cannot be understood through the &#8220;reconstruction&#8221; and &#8220;aggregation&#8221; of individual dispositions just before their point of action (p. xi). Nor, he argues, can democratization be understood as a &#8220;product of age-old character traits or of short-term constitutional innovations&#8221; (p. 9).<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704700584","881-883","Nancy Bermeo","Princeton University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1111","168"

The purpose of Gary Marks's and Marco Steenbergen's volume is to subject this common assumption to systematic empirical scrutiny.

Most scholars viewed the region as a cotton colony of the Soviet Union dominated by a largely traditional, feudal society impervious to Western understanding. Despite greater access to the region and its peoples in the wake of the collapse of communism, the perception that the region remained under Moscow's shadow continued to suppress interest among nonspecialists.

But most scholars studying Cuba doubted that Castro would be so easily dislodged. They cited manifest differences between Cuban and European communism: Cuba had an authentic revolution that began with broad support, whereas communism arrived in most of Eastern Europe in the rucksack of the Red Army. Cuban nationalism bolstered the legitimacy of a government in conflict with the United States, whereas European nationalism corroded the legitimacy of regimes beholden to Soviet Russia. The standard of living in communist Europe paled in comparison to that of the West, whereas Cuban conditions compared favorably to much of Latin America and the Caribbean. European communist regimes were led by colorless bureaucrats who had long since lost faith in their own ideology, whereas Cuba was still led by the charismatic Fidel Castro and the generation that made the revolution.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704630581","874-875","William M.

The book, he writes, &#8220;seeks to explain how state institutions affect ethnic mobilization,&#8221; through a focusing on the upsurge of nationalist sentiment that took place in both the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during the late 1980s and early 1990s (p. xi). In addition, the book also intends to challenge the widely held perception that &#8220;governing elites can kindle latent ethnic grievances virtually at will&#8221; and &#8220;to shift the study of ethnic mobilization from the whys of its emergence to the hows of its development as a political force&#8221; (p. xi).

The core thesis of this impressive study by Katherine Cramer Walsh maintains that small groups work collectively to create social contexts that influence members' understanding of politics. Individuals develop perspective through their identification and experiences with a group. She argues that people's ability to engage in &#8220;oppositional processing&#8221; by juxtaposing their own social position to that of others shapes their political outlook.

Her study of Prohibition politics and organizational strategies crafted over time brings together insights from new institutionalists who explain how the unique interests of governmental agencies and &#8220;states&#8221; shape policy outcomes, as well as from political scientists whose studies on the relationships between ideologies, political strategies, and small group dynamics have generated varied pressures for policy reform.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, reforming Superfund was a salient political issue.

Most empirical efforts to examine issues of technological inequities within the United States have been primarily descriptive in nature and theoretically limited in scope.

Whereas the &#8220;indexing&#8221; model holds that news reflects the homogeneity of Washington elites, Entman's model has political communication going both ways: Presidential administrations and Washington elites (congressmen, ex-government officials, lobbyists, academic experts) are guided and constrained by the news (actual or anticipated), just as news organizations tailor the news according to public opinion (actual or anticipated).

Published shortly after Reagan was laid to rest, Bill Clinton's autobiography also reflects our modern preoccupation with rhetorical leadership. Clinton credits many of his political victories&#8212;most notably fending off an impeachment charge&#8212;to the power of rhetorical appeals. He also attributes many of his failures to an inability to communicate effectively. George Edwards thinks that Reagan, Clinton, and the conventional wisdom they exemplify are just plain wrong. In a thorough and forcefully articulated study, Edwards argues that public opinion is never altered by presidential speech.

Relying on secondary and original sources, she identifies four different sets of entrepreneurs&#8212;social workers, conservatives, women legislators/women's groups, and fathers' rights groups. Crowley claims that over the long term, policies continuously evolve and actors enter, exit, and reenter the political arena. Policy entrepreneurs are the central actors who create policy change. She defines policy entrepreneurs as people who are alert to new opportunities, persist in advocating their ideas, and employ rhetorical ingenuity to frame their ideas in novel ways (p. 8). Groups, as well as individuals, have these entrepreneurial characteristics. Changes in child support policy, in the author's view, can be explained by changes in the domination of the political arena of different entrepreneurial groups.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704330586","836-838","Lael R.

In classic separation-of-power models, justices do not craft opinions they know will be overridden, and Congress does not pass laws likely to be struck down or interpreted in a manner hostile to Congress's interests. In reality, the assumption of complete information is tenuous: The transmission of information between the branches is less than perfect. Members of Congress lack the capacity to perfectly anticipate future judicial decisions, and courts cannot anticipate how elected officials will respond. Hence, congressional goals are regularly thwarted by the courts, and on occasion, judicial attempts at policymaking are overruled by Congress.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704310583","834-835","Forrest Maltzman","George Washington University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1235","121"

By Vickie B. Sullivan. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 284p. $75.00.In this important and insightful book Vickie B. Sullivan offers an impressive and ambitious examination of the philosophical roots and historical development of liberal democratic theory in early-modern England. In the Introduction, Sullivan frames her analysis in the context of the various contours of the debate about the character of early-modern thought between the advocates of classical republicanism, on the one hand, and the proponents of the liberal school, on the other. The opening chapters on Machiavelli and Hobbes, respectively, provide a provocative interpretive lens through which to evaluate and critique the prevailing liberal and republican paradigms. The lion's share of the book deals in five successive chapters with the way in which English republicans from the civil war era through the early Hanoverian period&#8212;including Marchamont Nedham, James Harrington, Henry Neville, Algernon Sidney, and the coauthors of Cato'sLetters, John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon&#8212;modified, balanced, and ultimately synthesized the Machiavellian republican and Hobbesian liberal elements of their complex philosophical inheritance. With the final consummation of this synthesis in the commercial republic of Cato'sLetters, Sullivan argues, a distinctively modern form of liberal republicanism was born.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704300587","833-834","Lee Ward","University of Regina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2422","414"

Yet, as is often the case, court cases provide concrete examples of conflicts that capture the attention of the popular press and the public. If polygamy is part of a religious or cultural tradition, can state and federal laws forbid it within the United States? If a recent immigrant to the United States belongs to a tradition that permits an &#8220;honor killing&#8221; to punish the improper sexual behavior of a female relative, to what extent is that immigrant legally culpable? Many of the cases discussed in the book present extraordinarily difficult conflicts between cultural traditions.

Indeed, far from being uniquely aligned with imperialism, eighteenth-century political thought was distinctive for generating such an opposition.

Is it to promote a national identity, to champion certain values, or to encourage a respect for difference? Are such goals suitable to the increasing cultural diversification of nations and the ongoing globalization of the world? And how should liberals respond when parents demand that children be exempt from classes that conflict with their beliefs or fight for state-supported religious education on the basis of group rights? These are just some of the questions taken up in this rich collection of essays. CitizenshipandEducationinLiberal-DemocraticSocieties brings together prominent political philosophers and educational theorists to discuss some of the most contentious educational policy issues confronting liberal-democratic states today. With a philosophical rigor often missing from such debates, the authors in this collection provide insight into the complex legal and moral issues at stake, locate the debates in historical and philosophical context, and present ethical arguments and curricular recommendations that advance dialogue. Read together, these essays defend the liberal state against charges that public education undermines parental authority and threatens cultural integrity, and they make a strong case for state involvement in education.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704260583","828-829","Karen Zivi","University of Southern California","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1946","464"

By Patchen Markell. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003. 320p. $59.50 cloth, $19.95 paper.Mainstream views of justice have typically concerned themselves with the distribution of goods such as money, power, opportunity, and liberty. In recent years, however, the traditionally neglected good of recognition has become a major focus of attention in contemporary politics and political theory. Stirred by a growing awareness of the pluralistic character of modern societies, many people now believe that recognition is something that is owed as a matter of justice. Just as poverty and a denial of liberty can have catastrophic implications for a person's well-being and self-development, misrecognition and nonrecognition can demean and insult an individual, leaving him or her with a crippling feeling of inferiority. In response to perceived failures of recognition, identity-related groups have called for significant changes in public policies and institutions: Political debates about everything from the college curriculum to laws regulating marriage, to language rights and race-conscious districting, to institutions of self-government for indigenous peoples and national minorities have been framed as &#8220;struggles for recognition.&#8221;<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704250587","826-828","Alan Patten","McGill University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2747","282"

Practical reason can build democratic community, but only if it is carefully delineated from manipulative sophistry and an excessively theoretical reason that seeks logical rigor to the detriment of decent practices.

But once we see political life in different terms, what will we be moved to do? Redesign our political institutions? Or revise our reasons for supporting those that currently exist? As the authors of the three books reviewed here illustrate, those who have taken up deliberative theories of democracy are moved to engage in profoundly different kinds of projects, marked either by redesign or revision. Bruce Ackerman, James Fishkin, and Ethan Leib believe their commitments to theories of deliberative democracy require them to focus on drafting extensive plans for institutional redesign. By contrast, Henry Richardson, while endorsing institutional reforms, ranging from changing electoral law to opening administrative rule making to greater citizen participation (pp. 200&#8211;202, 219&#8211;22), devotes the majority of his book to showing how the ideals of his theory of deliberative democracy can make better and more complete sense of political life as it is. The deep contrast between how these authors understand what one ought to do with a commitment to deliberative democracy prompts us to consider whether they are simply committed to different things or are striking out on different paths from substantially similar starting points instead.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704210581","821-823","Emily Hauptmann","Western Michigan University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1947","295"

Although psychology has always been an important component of political analysis, the prevalence of these books suggests a growing, or renewed, interest among political scientists in using insights from social and cognitive psychology to understand political phenomena&#8212;an interest that spurs these scholarly attempts to demarcate the conceptual and methodological structure of political psychology as a subfield. As Wendy Rahn, John Sullivan, and Thomas Rudolph have noted, this interest has emerged over the years partly in response to the rise of rational choice theory in political science. Regardless of the specific topic at hand, political psychology research often challenges the assumptions of rational choice models and adds nuance to the insights of rational choice theory. It offers rigorous empirical demonstrations of how systematic and predictable psychological processes affect whether traditional assumptions of rationality do or do not hold and, conversely, how the structure of political institutions affects psychological processes. These empirical critiques and modifications of rational choice theory make political psychology a compelling line of inquiry to scholars from a variety of methodological and substantive backgrounds. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Deborah J.

To generate the predictions, the researchers turned to approaches to decision making dominant in their respective fields. The political scientists devised a statistical model, which assumes, in line with the vast disciplinary literature on the subject, that judicial decisions are largely a function of politics and case facts. The legal academics went in a different direction. To tap a common belief in their field&#8212;that Court decisions reflect law and jurisprudential principles&#8212;they asked appellate lawyers and legal scholars (&#8220;experts&#8221; in particular areas of the law) to predict the outcome of each of the term's decisions. The researchers then posted all the forecasts on the Project's Web site (http://wusct.wustl.edu), along with the actual votes and outcomes as the Court handed down its decisions. As it turned out, the statistical model produced far more accurate predictions of case outcomes than the experts (75 percent versus 59.1 percent), while the experts did marginally better at forecasting the votes of individual justices (67.9 percent versus 66.7 percent). <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> <br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fna'><sup>a</sup> Lee Epstein thanks Jennifer L.

I contend that corporate freedom of conscience in its state-sponsored applications often unfairly affects those who do not subscribe to the beliefs of religious organizations. I thus reject public funding of religiously based organizations, or those in which religious faith is a central organizing element, unless the recipients are required to adhere to the rules that govern secularly based organizations. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704040484","741-755","Emily R.

Yet in many contexts, informal institutions, ranging from bureaucratic and legislative norms to clientelism and patrimonialism, shape even more strongly political behavior and outcomes. Scholars who fail to consider these informal rules of the game risk missing many of the most important incentives and constraints that underlie political behavior. In this article we develop a framework for studying informal institutions and integrating them into comparative institutional analysis. The framework is based on a typology of four patterns of formal-informal institutional interaction: complementary, accommodating, competing, and substitutive. We then explore two issues largely ignored in the literature on this subject: the reasons and mechanisms behind the emergence of informal institutions, and the nature of their stability and change. Finally, we consider challenges in research on informal institutions, including issues of identification, measurement, and comparison. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704040472","725-740","and Steven Levitsky","Steven Levitsky is associate professor of government at Harvard University (<a href=mailto:levitsky@wcfia.harvard.edu>levitsky@wcfia.harvard.edu)","Gretchen Helmke","Gretchen Helmke is assistant professor of political science at the University of Rochester (<a href=mailto:hlmk@mail.rochester.edu>hlmk@mail.rochester.edu)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","24689","8122"

For the most part, political scientists are either unfamiliar with the social side of evolutionary theory or misidentify its key features. Far from being genetically deterministic or leading exclusively to predictions that all human behavior will be selfish, modern evolutionary theories stress that adaptive behavior is frequently characterized by a guarded sort of cooperation. We describe modern biological theory, offer our own version of it, discuss new and potentially useful interpretations of political attitudes and public policies, and present scientific evidence, drawn from research on autistic individuals and monozygotic and dizygotic twins, of the startlingly important role genetics plays in shaping politically relevant attitudes and behaviors. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592704040460","707-723","John R.

A fifteen-member task force was convened in January 2003 and collectively worked during the subsequent eighteen months to prepare extensive reviews of research on inequality and American democracy. (The research reviews are available on the APSA Web site&#8212;as are materials for undergraduate and graduate teaching&#8212;http://www.apsanet.org/inequality.) Based on three reviews, the task force prepared a short report, which forms the basis of the present text. It concludes that progress toward realizing American ideals of democracy may have stalled&#8212;and in some arenas reversed. The task force&#39;s work was extensively and rigorously debated among its members, scrutinized by three distinguished independent peers, and reviewed by the APSA Council. This report is ultimately the responsibility of its authors; no opinions, statements of fact, or conclusions should be attributed to the American Political Science Association or to the Russell Sage Foundation, which provided some support to the task force.

[I]t is perhaps most of all for those of us who were not there at all: to learn the lessons, to deepen our memories and our humanity, and to transmit these lessons from generation to generation.&#8221; One of the principal lessons of the Holocaust, he suggested, was that the United States and other countries should have done more to prevent it or to rescue more victims from the Nazi killing machine:Even as our fragmentary awareness of crimes grew into indisputable facts, far too little was done.

The magnitude and scope of its impact on current political life is, however, a matter of intense debate. Political theorists have conspicuously not been at the forefront of these race-specific discussions. This is not because political theory has ignored race per se. On the contrary, contemporary political theorists increasingly include race in their descriptive and normative analyses of democratic politics. Debates about identity politics, multiculturalism, the redress of invidious discrimination, and feminist discourse on intersecting social identifications have moved from the margin to the center of political theory and typically involve at least some attention to racial difference. But these discussions have for the most part not examined racial meaning in a sustained, focused manner.

A half century of U.S. leadership in constructing an international order organized around multilateral institutions, rule-based agreements, and alliance partnerships seems to be giving way to an assertive unilateralism. But how deeply rooted is this unilateral turn? Is it an inevitable feature of America&#39;s rising global power position? This article argues that the United States is not doomed to shed its multilateral orientation. Unipolar power provides new opportunities for the United States to act unilaterally, but the incentives are actually quite complex and cross-cutting; and these incentives arguably make multilateralism more rather than less desirable for Washington in many policy areas.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703000380","533-550","G.

If so, is that a good reason to strive for a world of safe, secure nations? Many liberal nationalists answer yes to these questions, but they do so without looking at the large social-psychology literature on groups and self-esteem. We examine the claims of liberal nationalists in light of this literature. The good news is that self-respect <a href='#fn1'><sup>1</sup> and group identity are strongly connected and can lead people to place collective interests above individual interests. The bad news is that the liberal-nationalist assumption that low-status groups have little self-respect and majority groups have it in abundance is mistaken. Perhaps most worrisome is the competitive nature of collective self-esteem: people feel better when their group does better than others. This competitiveness can lead to outright hostility when groups compete for resources and political power. Self-esteem is clearly an unstable foundation for a liberal nation. Although we do not think that problems caused by national identity and self-esteem can be fully solved, we do suggest ways in which they can be contained.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703000379","515-532","Jeff Spinner-Halev","Schlesinger Professor of Political Science at the University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln (<a href=mailto:jspinner@unl.edu>jspinner@unl.edu).

Especially in recent years, this has led many observers to question the importance of the presidency and bureaucracy to the real work of American governance and the extent to which political actors in the executive branch generally exercise power. This narrative of congressional dominance has been particularly bolstered by recent scholarly interest in principal-agent models of interbranch relations. The assumption of congressional centrality, however, obscures many important features of American politics. Over the course of American history, institutional development in particular has often been driven by either autonomous executive action or conflicts between Congress and the executive. We develop an approach for assessing executive power in institutional politics and illustrate the logic of executive influence with three cases: the rise of federal food-and-drug and forestry regulation, and the growth of the federal farm extension service in the early twentieth century; the rise of the national security state in the mid-twentieth century; and the evolution of budgeting and spending practices over the course of the twentieth century.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703000367","495-513","and Daniel P.

The disjunction between dynamics at the top and at the bottom undermines prevailing assumptions about civil wars, which are informed by two competing interpretive frames, most recently described as &#8220;greed and grievance.&#8221; Rather than posit a dichotomy between greed and grievance, I point to the interaction between political and private identities and actions. Civil wars are not binary conflicts, but complex and ambiguous processes that foster the &#8220;joint&#8221; action of local and supralocal actors, civilians, and armies, whose alliance results in violence that aggregates yet still reflects their diverse goals. It is the convergence of local motives and supralocal imperatives that endows civil wars with their particular and often puzzling character, straddling the divide between the political and the private, the collective and the individual.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703000355","475-494","Stathis N.

By Kristen P. Williams. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2001. 224p. $65.00 cloth, $22.50 paper","The linkage between nationalism, or to be more precise ethnonationalism, and international relations is now at the center of world politics. Following years in which this dimension has been neglected in our literature, the discipline has finally caught up with the reality that most of the conflicts taking place around the world are related to the politics of national or ethnic identity. To be sure, political science responded earlier to the call of Walker Connor (&#8220;Nation Building or Nation Destroying,&#8221; WorldPolitics 24 [April 1972]: 319&#8211;55) and Anthony Smith (TheEthnicRevival 1981) to supplant the notion of the integrated modern state with a more pluralistic approach. Following the end of the Cold War, international relations as a discipline had no choice but to pay attention to ethnicity. As expected, once the phenomenon was recognized, the literature grew extensively in both the theoretical and empirical areas. In recent years, even Michael Brecher's and Jonathan Wilkenfeld's prestigious International Crisis Behavior (ICB) worldwide data set had to turn around and adopt an ethnic variable. Patrick James and David Carment, using the ICB empirical stockpile, dedicated a large portion of their work to the ethnic dimension of international crises. Similarly, T. R. Gurr, also a former president of the International Studies Association (like Brecher), made an about-turn and focused his work on conflict through his Minorities At Risk (MAR) database on ethnicity. Kristen Williams's book is thus another attempt to integrate international relations theory and ethnic politics literature while basing it on empirical research. Despite some flaws, this book should be welcomed into the growing literature on nationalism and international conflict. It has two theoretical and four empirical chapters, each covering a different case, starting with Bismarck and German unification and proceeding to Bosnia, Kosovo, and Kashmir.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703350169","239-240","Shmuel Sandler","Bar-Ilan University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","750","203"

Given the nature of international relations after the Cold War, from developments centered on northern Iraq in 1991 to those centered on Kosovo in 1999, we now have a multitude of sources dealing with the use of military force presumably in response to gross violations of human rights. In fact, the number of publications on this topic is in inverse proportion to the actual number of possible humanitarian interventions. Most atrocities do not result in outside intervention, as events in the 1990s in Rwanda and the Democratic Congo and Nigeria should remind us. Perhaps we have so many of these studies because appearances of humanitarian intervention so clearly flout the principle of state sovereignty and noninterference in the domestic affairs of states, which constitute fundamental notions of the Westphalian state system of world order.

By Kelly M. Kadera. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2001. 208p. $47.50","A long-standing debate in the field of international relations concerns the relationship between power and conflict. While balance of power (BOP) theorists view parity as a condition preserving peace, power transition (PT) theorists argue that parity (and transitions) between the dominant (global or regional) power and a dissatisfied challenger make war more likely. Kelly Kadera asserts that empirical evidence on whether parity is peaceful or dangerous is quite mixed. She attempts to reconcile these seemingly disparate theories by developing a dynamic model of power and conflict. She argues that the empirical puzzle stemming from the BOP-PT debate can be resolved by &#8220;defining three types of power distribution: approximate parity, a decisive advantage, and overwhelming preponderance&#8221; (p. 81). She develops a series of dynamic models that apply under each of these conditions. The key variables in each model are a state's power and the conflict it sends and receives from its rival. She assumes that 1) a state's power is generated by a dynamic process (capturing internal growth); 2) a state's power is negatively affected by the conflict a rival directs against it; and 3) more powerful states are able to direct increasing amounts of conflict toward their rivals.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703240160","228-229","Sara McLaughlin Mitchell","Florida State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","660","103"

Haley provides a useful overview of the political efforts of nation-states, multilateral institutions, investment banks, and money managers to pry open markets in societies otherwise starved for capital. This cooperation between political and private sector elites favored schemes that offered opportunities to investment banks and money managers, based for the most part in the United States, Western Europe and Japan, to expand their purchases of stocks, bonds, and various securities options in the developing world. In this context, she argues that institutional investors, including large-scale corporations such as investment banks and money managers of pension and mutual funds, have consolidated their economic power to the point of exercising political influence over governmental policies in the lessdeveloped world.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703220168","227-228","Ronald W.

He notes quite correctly that this is both a product of Nigeria's historical experiences and the character of postcolonial politics, but more importantly, the legacy of decades of military dictatorship with its commandist style of rule. This political reality, according to the author, is further complicated by several fault lines in Nigerian politics and society: the North-South divide, Christian-Muslim antagonism, ethnic suspicions and conflicts, majority-minority ethnic calculations, oil and nonoil state struggles, and a political elite that has found it rather challenging to build a national project.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703890151","223-223","Julius O.

So stupendous was the growth of Japan's economy during the 1960s and 1970s that by the 1980s, numerous books had been published with hubristic titles about Japan's position vis-&agrave;-vis the United States in the world political economy, such as JapanasNumberOne and JapaninthePassingLane. Japan is lauded for its economic prowess and often touted as a model of development to be emulated by other countries. Its economic position in international affairs, however, is not matched with commensurate political influence. This is due in part to Article 9 in the &#8220;MacArthur&#8221; Constitution in which Japan declared it would forgo offensive military capabilities. Moreover, an avuncular military relationship with the United States allowed Japan to free ride on American grand strategy during the Cold War. This strategy was a linchpin of the Yoshida doctrine and is still the foundation of Japan's security policy in the post&#8211;Cold War era. The dichotomy between Japan's economic position and its political position in international affairs has led to a myriad of catchphrases regarding Japan's foreign policy.

In this new book, Simon Hug attempts to move beyond existing studies to create generalizable hypotheses capable of predicting when we should expect these phenomena to occur. It is innovative both in terms of its approach, which is explicitly game-theoretic, and in its goal to move toward a truly generalizable theory of new party formation (and, to some degree, success).

Focusing on five large and diverse regions of the world: Africa, the Middle East, Eurasia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Asia (India and China), Marcus Franda demonstrates that any analysis of the impact of the Internet has to take into account that the process of the integration and diffusion of information communication technologies (ICTs) varies enormously, not just from one region to the next but often from country to country. Consequently, the political scientist should be wary of drawing generalized conclusions about the impact of the Internet globally. Indeed, in many ways Franda's account of its impact provides a healthy degree of skepticism to many of the more technologically deterministic and &#8220;libertarian&#8221; accounts of the impact of ICTs. His account demonstrates that in nearly all of the countries examined, far from &#8220;withering away,&#8221; the state has played a decisive role either in creating a conducive environment for the Internet to develop or, conversely, in retarding its development by adopting regulations to administer and control access.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703720155","207-208","Jason Paul Abbott","Nottingham Trent University","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1714","213"

The work is unable to serve as a thoroughgoing analysis and critique of neoliberalism, because this becomes an object of study from the varying perspectives of the 13 contributors, rather than being built into a coherent, developing thesis. This would probably have required a single author or small group of authors, rather than the editors-pluscontributors format. Institutional analysis is, however, confronted cumulatively, because the internal organization of the book is based around different approaches to such analysis, rather than around different aspects of neoliberalism.

In so doing, Cheryl Shanks usefully reminds us that immigration is one of those policy domains&#8212;like foreign policy&#8212;that is inescapably and fundamentally regime shaping. At the same time, she seeks to demonstrate that &#8220;to preserve or enhance sovereignty is a policy choice&#8221; (p. 2), albeit one whose determinants change over time. Indeed, the bulk of this work is an historical analysis of the Congressional Record, scrutinizing how U.S. sovereignty has been conceived of differently over the last century and how this has influenced immigration policy. This effort leads Shanks to the provocative conclusion that &#8220;immigration policy has become more restrictive as trade policy has become less protectionist&#8221; (p. 253); more specifically, that as we have become less concerned with racial and ideological admission criteria, we have become more concerned with total numbers of immigrants and their &#8220;quality,&#8221; in terms of human capital. For Shanks, the point is that the tension between maintaining sovereignty and fostering involvement in an open and dynamic world economy is central to understanding contemporary immigration policy.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703600150","196-197","Peter Skerry","Claremont McKenna College and The Brookings Institution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","696","91"

This theme, of course, is not new. Indeed, the last two decades have seen a slow but steady emergence of the new regionalist perspective as a counterbalance to the now dominant public-choice emphasis on the virtues of jurisdictional fragmentation. Previously, the regionalist perspective was perhaps best reflected in David Rusk's CitiesWithoutSuburbs (1993) or Anthony Downs's NewVisionsforMetropolitanAmerica (1994).

Terry Nardin seems inspired by Oakeshott to take this attitude a step further, as if to say a political philosopher may have an analysis of political activity, but a philosopher has something more significant, a comprehensive view of human experience, and it is this that is profitable for a later age to study. Thus, the title of Nardin's book, ThePhilosophyofMichaelOakeshott holds the nugget of his thesis: Michael Oakeshott was a philosopher, and it is as a philosopher, not a political theorist or a moralist or a historian of ideas, that we must first come to know him.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703390152","175-176","Steven A.

By Fiona MacKay. London: Continuum, 2001. 242p. $90.95 cloth, 28.95 paper","These two books represent an evolution in the ethic of care literature by taking up the challenge of how to combine care and politics. Fiona MacKay argues that women's full inclusion into democratic politics requires the use of a political ethic of care to reshape the nature of representative institutions, at a variety of levels of governance, from local to transnational. Nel Noddings argues that the care ethic practiced in ideal homes should be taken into the state to redirect public policy. In developing the arguments, both stress women's experiences of caring for others and both counterpose care and justice. Their theoretical discussions of the ethic of care cover familiar ground, with Noddings's maternalist version and MacKay's nonmaternalist formulation. Where both books depart from the literature is in their uncritical embrace of the state as a policymaking engine or as the site for representative institutions. While Noddings uses the ethic of care to argue for a series of compassionate public policies, ranging from housing for the homeless to education in caring, her analysis does not engage with feminist discussions of care and the welfare state. The appeal of StartingatHome is that Noddings places the raising of caring human beings at the center of a policy agenda. LoveandPolitics is much more compelling for political scientists, because MacKay offers a political analysis of how moments of democratization, such as Scotland's devolution process, could advance a redefining of politics in a more woman-friendly, caring direction. The juxtaposition of the two books suggests that the success of Noddings's humanistic vision rests on a complicated political project: the creation of a family and woman-friendly practice of democratic politics shaped by women's equal political agency and a political ethic of care.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703340150","170-171","Wendy Sarvasy","California State University, Hayward","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1200","144"

Defining and contesting citizenship is a high-stakes enterprise, and in light of the current climate, Engin F. Isin's BeingPolitical is a timely intervention into these debates. It is a series of genealogies that describe citizenship as alterity in cities, chronologically spanning urban spaces from the Athenian polis through the present-day cosmopolis. Taking his methodological cue from Michel Foucault, Isin's genealogies seek to break up the continuous narratives of citizenship imagined by the victors of history&#8212;that democratic citizenship in the United States, for example, is the direct descendant of Athenian democracy&#8212;and reveal the disparate forms that citizenship and its others have taken over time.

By Jon Hesk. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001. 344p. $65.00","This thoughtful and wide-ranging book addresses a problem that is as salient for modern as for ancient democracies: Given that democracy is necessarily predicated on judging the worth of public speech, how can democratic decision makers, whether legislators or jurors, know when speech is truthful? The Athenian political orator Demosthenes put the issue clearly: &#8220;Where the political constitution is based on speeches, how can it be safely administered if the speeches are false?&#8221; (Demosthenes [OntheFalseEmbassy] 19.185; Hesk, p. 164). Jon Hesk shows how that question becomes sharper with the availability of ever more sophisticated techniques of persuasion. Democrats today agonize over the problem of &#8220;spin&#8221;: manipulation of the media by professionals who are cherished by politicians for their ability to persuade voters to believe that which is advantageous to their paymasters. Hesk cites a well-chosen array of modern examples, drawn primarily from British politics. In ancient Athens, a similar concern centered on techniques of persuasion associated with professional teachers of rhetoric: the socalled sophists.

Albany: State University of New York Press, 2001. 245p. $60.50 cloth, $20.95 paper.","The work of J&uuml;rgen Habermas seems to have a rather ambiguous relation to its origins in Frankfurt School critical theory. On the one hand, Habermas portrays his own work as vindicating the Frankfurt school's goal of finding a location for rational autonomy against the various forces of instrumental reasoning that treat all agency from the vantage point of means&#8211; ends reasoning. On the other hand, Habermas insists that he can only vindicate that goal by divesting himself of the Frankfurt school's preoccupation with finding a form of consciousness undistorted by reified social relations. In place of the critique of reification and false consciousness, Habermas offers us a critique of distorted communication built on academic disciplines well outside the dialectical theories of Theodor Adorno or Max Horkheimer: Specifically, he derives his theory of undistorted communication from an account of the presuppositions of speech acts derived from analytic language philosophy, and he inserts this notion into a theory of society based upon the systems theories of Talcott Parsons and Niklas Luhmann. This ambiguity has spawned the most disparate commentary. One strand of interpretation seeks to assess the relation of his theory of communicative reason to the original Frankfurt school project of criticizing reified consciousness. A completely different strand of interpretation, rooted in analytic moral philosophy, seeks to draw out the implications of his theory of communicative reason for finding a procedure to produce moral agreement. The two books under review are fine exemplars of each of these directions, although this short review can hardly do justice to the quality of argument and rigor of Joseph Heath's book.<br><hr></td></tr></table>","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703290150","164-166","Peter Breiner","State University of New York at Albany","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","823","218"

Robert Putnam says that the concept has been invented at least six times during the twentieth century, and its definition has been reconceived. Much current research uses Putnam's definition of social capital&#8212;&#8220;features of social organizations, such as trust, norms, and networks, that can improve the efficiency of society by facilitating coordinated actions.&#8221; Yet political science does not have a corner on the market of research when it comes to studying the concept. Research on social capital has been done&#8212;and is being done&#8212; in economics, geography, history, demography, sociology, African studies, African American studies, Asian studies, education, ecology, and psychology. In some instances, these disciplines have used the same definition for the term as political science has; in others, that has not been the case. Despite differences in definition, how might other disciplines' research inform our assessment of the effects of social capital? Conversely, what might political science offer to other disciplines to inform their analyses?<br><hr><h3>Footnotes</h3><a name='fn1'><sup>1</sup> I must thank Shayla C.

Does a rational calculus lie beneath the nationalist pride and passions? Can it be discovered if only we apply our understanding of rationality more creatively? This article seeks to answer these questions by focusing on the nationalism of resistance. It argues that a focus on dignity, self-respect, and recognition, rather than a straightforward notion of self-interest, is a better prism for understanding ethnic and nationalist behavior, although self-interest is not entirely absent as a motivation in ethnic conflict. In the process of developing this argument, a distinction once made by Max Weber&#8212;between instrumental rationality and value rationality&#8212;is recovered and refined further.No more arresting emblems of the modern culture of nationalism exist than cenotaphs and tombs of Unknown Soldiers &#8230;. They are either deliberately empty or no one knows who lies inside them &#8230;. The cultural significance of such monuments becomes even clearer if one tries to imagine, say, a Tomb of the Unknown Marxist or a cenotaph for fallen Liberals. Is a sense of absurdity avoidable? The reason is that neither Marxism nor Liberalism is much concerned with death and immortality. If the nationalist imagining is so concerned, this suggests a strong affinity with religious imaginings &#8230;.&#8212;Benedict Anderson, ImaginedCommunities, 1983' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703000069","85-99","Ashutosh Varshney","associate professor of political science at the University of Michigan (<a href=mailto:varshney@umich.edu>varshney@umich.edu).","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15676","5335"

What American labor can do, however, is to become once again a social movement. In order for organized labor to play its critical role as a countervailing power within the American political system, there must be intensified organizing, internal democratization, increased electoral and lobbying clout, and social-movement unions willing to mobilize with others and, if necessary, on the streets. <a href='#fna'><sup>a</sup> ' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703000045","45-68","Margaret Levi","Jere L.

First, the George W. Bush administration claims that its cause and conduct in counterterror war are just. Such a claim invites moral assessment. How do normative beliefs and ethical concerns affect U.S. conduct in the counterterror war? Is the war just in cause and conduct? Second, many observers argue that warfare is &#8220;transformed.&#8221; How so? And is it possible to fight a just counterterror war in this context? Third, the transformation of war raises new questions for just war theory itself. Is the framework still useful? I argue that it is extremely difficult to fight a just counterterror war given the nature of terrorism and the realities of contemporary warfare. Yet I show that the Bush administration has made an effort to engage in a just counterterror war by meeting the criterion of self-defense and seeking to avoid noncombatant harm. Even so, current U.S. policy and practice in the counterterror war are not just. But any government would have a problem fighting a just counterterror war in the current context; indeed, the utility of just war theory itself is challenged. I discuss 12 conceptual and practical problems that arise at the intersection of just war theory and counterterror war, including the limits of self-defense, preemption, last resort, and discrimination. Despite these problems, I argue that just war theory is a useful method of inquiry into the problems of contemporary war.Our nation&#39;s cause has always been larger than our nation&#39;s defense. We fight, as we always fight, for a just peace&#8212;a peace that favors human liberty &#8230;. Building this just peace is America&#39;s opportunity, and America&#39;s duty. &#8212;George W.

Just as the flukish order in which cases appear and the idiosyncrasies of their fact patterns shape precedent, the timing of research determines whether judges notice it. Judges are more likely to incorporate social science research into their opinions if it fulfills a pressing need and addresses an important shift in thinking.

We call attention to the enormous disparity in ballot designs across the states and to individual state designs that are inconsistent and needlessly complex.

Or is it a booming area of devolved powers in our federalist system, creating more innovation and efficient small-scale bargaining than out-of-touch regulators in Washington do? Surprisingly, state regulation is becoming more important in shaping American firms operating in global markets. I present a revised interpretation of American regulatory federalism, including the &#8220;gap filling&#8221; or &#8220;re-enforcement&#8221; efforts by some state legislatures or attorneys general as federal regulators relax enforcement efforts. I summarize the results of 10 new quantitative studies of major regulated industries across the 50 states and over time. Overall, capture or rent-seeking models do not explain most regulatory areas, which show considerable interest-group contestation and provide room for institutional actors to wield autonomous, influential power. The heightened salience of state regulation is reflected by increased gubernatorial effort in many states, parallel to recent presidential efforts to centralize regulatory policy-making.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703000215","291-306","Paul Teske","Has been a professor of political science at Stony Brook University since earning his Ph.D. at Princeton University in 1989 (<a href=mailto:paul.teske@sunysb.edu>paul.teske@sunysb.edu).

They all illustrate instances where marginalized groups challenge a lack of democracy or the limitations of existing democracy. Democracy is both a process and a product of struggles against power. Both the social capital literature and literature that focuses on democracy as a product of institutions can undervalue the actions of regular people who imagine a democratic world beyond anything that actually exists. The four cases examined in this article demonstrate that marginalized groups use a variety of performative and subversive methods to uproot the public sphere from its exclusionary history as they imagine, on their own terms, democratic possibilities that did not previously exist. In so doing, they plant the seeds of a more egalitarian public politics in new times and places. This process is &#8220;contentious pluralism,&#8221; and we ask political scientists in all subfields to look to popular movements and changing political structures as they explore the promise of democracy and to rethink the gap between democracy as an ideal and the ways in which people actually experience it.The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle. The conflict has been exciting, agitating, all-absorbing, and for the time being, putting all other tumults to silence. It must do this or it does nothing. If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the roar of its waters. The struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be moral and physical, but it must be a struggle.

Through a discussion of the Egyptian case, this essay shows how the rise of Islamism can be illuminated by findings of the literatures on revolution and civil society, and vice versa. As many leading theories on revolutions would predict, the necessary precondition for Islamism&#39;s rise has been the declining efficacy and legitimacy of the state. Yet what has occurred in Egypt (and other parts of the Arab world) is not a successful revolution but a peculiar stalemate in which the existing regime retains political power while ceding substantial control over the societal and cultural spheres to the revolutionary challenger&#8212;an outcome that the literature does not envision. This stalemate, in turn, is largely a consequence of Islamists&#39; ability to expand their presence in civil society. This expansion in Egypt and other Arab countries over recent decades is thus best understood as a sign not of benign liberalization, but rather of profound political failure, and as an incubator for illiberal radicalism.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1537592703000197","257-272","Sheri Berman","Visiting scholar at the Center for European Studies at New York University (<a href=mailto:seberman@hotmail.com>seberman@hotmail.com).

Through an examination of the &#8220;turn to ideas&#8221; undertaken in the past decade by rationalist and nonrationalist scholars in both comparative politics and international relations, it seeks to make three points. First, interests are far from the unproblematic and ever-ready explanatory instruments we assume them to be. Second, the ideational turn of historical institutionalism and constructivist international relations theory marks a substantive theoretical shift in the field precisely because it problematizes notions of action that take interest as given. Third, such scholarship emerged from, and in reaction to, the inherent limits of rationalist treatments of interests and ideas.

We have tried here to show that subjectivity is valid and useful, that firstperson accounts of experience&#8212;&#8216;telling what I know,&#8221; narratives of and by the self, partial and contingent truths, and self-asother ethnography&#8212;contribute to knowledge. The move to subjective knowledge does not require the abandonment of objectivity. Self-consciousness and reflexivity simply make it possible to render the familiar unfamiliar, to gain a certain detachment, to achieve &#8220;objective subjectivity.&#8221; Subjective knowledge helps to explain identity and category formation and the politics of recognition. Accessibility to the politics of those taken to be outside the public sphere, those whose behavior is not easily observed or counted by objective political science&#8212;colonized persons, subalterns, and marginalized minorities&#8212;depends on their ability to articulate their identities, purposes, and interests. Such forms of identity politics have become of increasing interest to political scientists concerned with subaltern agency, multiculturalism, and ethnic conflict and peace.' + '","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S153759270300046X","681-694","Lloyd I.
